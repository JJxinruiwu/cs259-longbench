[ANSWER]
The professor thought that echoes and reverberation could be problematic, especially in the context of the SRI system, which relies heavily on accurate reconstruction of the original audio signal.

Specifically, the professor mentioned that:

* Echoes and reverberations can cause significant distortion in the reconstructed speech.
* The SRI system's reliance on accurate reconstruction of the original audio signal increases its susceptibility to echoes and reverberations.
* The professor suggested that the SRI system's implementation of reverberation filters could exacerbate these issues.

Overall, the professor expressed concern that the SRI system's ability to accurately reconstruct the
