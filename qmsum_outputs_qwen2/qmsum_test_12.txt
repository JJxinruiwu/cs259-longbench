[ANSWER]
The two lessons that can be learned from early implementer areas include:

1) The importance of communication with parents and providers about the availability of the offer and how to access it.

2) The need for clarity and uniformity in the administration of the offer across all areas, including pilot areas.

So the key messages are about effective communication, consistency in administration, and ensuring that the offer is accessible and user-friendly across all areas.
