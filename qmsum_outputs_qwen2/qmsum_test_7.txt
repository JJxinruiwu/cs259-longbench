Based on the document, the professor thinks MSG is:
1) Good. The MSG is a good network.
2) Bad. MSG has some problems.

The doc states:

"MSG seems like a good thing to do, probably, not again a short-term sort of thing."

So the professor thinks MSG is good, not bad. The doc suggests that MSG is "good", meaning it is a good network. However, the doc mentions that MSG has some problems, suggesting that it is not perfect. Therefore, the professor believes MSG is good, but not perfect.
