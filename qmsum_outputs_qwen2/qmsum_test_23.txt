Answer according to the document:

The document states that Industrial Design agreed with Marketing when discussing their presentations on the appearance design, stating that "they already have the technology in-house for the voice recognition" and "the solar power definitely would be but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed, 'cause sometimes solar power fails and there's no way round that, we should install a small backup battery." 

So the key reasons are that they had access to the technology in-house and Solar Power is likely to fail, and they believe installing a small backup battery could alleviate the annoyance.
