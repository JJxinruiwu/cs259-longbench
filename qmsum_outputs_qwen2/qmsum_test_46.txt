Based on the document, the key issues from the past meetings included:

1) The coach's feedback regarding the "touch screen" feature, which led to a decision to opt for a more traditional physical button instead.

2) The industrial designer's concerns about the potential for the remote to malfunction due to the presence of buttons, which led to a proposal for a more integrated design with a removable cover.

3) The user interface's suggestion for a "spongy" feel to the remote, which was rejected due to the complexity of the interface.

4) The industrial designer's concern about the potential for the remote to be misused
