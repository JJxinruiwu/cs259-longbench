[ANSWER]
Kirsty Williams' opinion was that the decision not to accredit the University of South Wales with the ability to deliver teacher training was "quite a complex picture". She believes that the lack of clarity on the funding for teacher training places the funding for part-time study under pressure, and that the funding for part-time study is dependent on the funding for full-time study. However, she does not believe that the lack of clarity on funding is the sole reason for the decision not to accredit the University of South Wales.
