What did they discuss and what did they decide?

ANSWER:
It was a meeting involving a remote control, a strawberry {disfmarker} device with advanced features, such as advanced chip, print, and speech recognition. The project was a prototype for a {disfmarker} device that could simulate the experience of holding a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} strawberry and tasting it {vocalsound} {vocalsound}. The {disfmarker} project involved several challenges, including meeting the financial criterion, evaluating the device's {disfmarker} technical specifications, and determining the optimal color {gap} and size of the device. The team also discussed the importance of team-work and communication {vocalsound} {vocalsound} to {gap} {disfmarker} succeed in achieving the project's goals.

The {disfmarker} project started {gap} 2013 and was supposed to be {gap} completed by 2014, but the project was delayed due to various reasons {disfmarker} {gap}. The team {gap} decided to cut the prototype in half and make it {gap} the {disfmarker} final device, focusing on the most important features {vocalsound} {vocalsound}. The device was {gap} the {disfmarker} prototype that {gap} {gap} and was used to simulate the experience of holding a {disfmarker} strawberry and tasting it {vocalsound} {vocalsound}. The team decided to use titanium for the final device, as it {gap} is a lightweight and strong material {vocalsound} {vocalsound}. The team also {gap} decided to add some features to the final device, including a {gap} hand dynamo, a battery, and a sensor for speech recognition {vocalsound} {vocalsound}.

The {disfmarker} project {gap} lasted for several months, during which the team {gap} discussed and decided on many {gap} important details, including the final design {gap} of the device, the materials to be used, and the {gap} budget {vocalsound} {vocalsound}. The team also {gap} decided to hold a party to celebrate the project's {gap} success {gap}.

The meeting concluded with the team {gap} deciding to cut the prototype in half, using titanium for the final
