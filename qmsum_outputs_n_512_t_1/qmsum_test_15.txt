According to the transcript, the professor was wondering, among other things, "What {disfmarker} does it leave {pause} you know, it leaves the junk. I mean, I {disfmarker} I think it's {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker} it's {vocalsound} uh, the junk, and that's just the low energy parts of the speech, where the reverberation is most audible." He said that the SRI system has a {disfmarker} more complex acoustic model than the Aurora system. The professor also noted that, "if you train the SRI system on Macrophone, it seems better on Meeting Recorder, but I don't think there's any difference between the two systems when it comes to the low energy components." 

(Answer)

The professor thought that the echoes and reverberation were related to the low energy parts of the speech, where the reverberation is most audible. He wanted to test the SRI system on noisy data to see if it could improve the SNR. He also noted that the VAD (Variable Annunciation Detection) process in the Aurora system was not very good, and that it would be beneficial to add noise to the system to help it identify the speech boundaries more accurately. Finally, he thought that the speech data was noisy, and that the noise could be filtered out using a combination of methods, including the VTS (Voice Typing System), cepstral domain normalization, and time constant filtering.
