How would the group prioritize voice recognition in a remote control?

[ANSWER]
The group believed that voice recognition is not a necessity and would only be preferred by those who are very wealthy. The group would prioritize voice recognition in a remote control as follows:

1. Separate the channel numbering system from the button keys.
2. Include voice recognition as an option with the main buttons.
3. Consider using a beeper button on the remote control.

The group was uncertain about how to implement voice recognition in a remote control, but they were more enthusiastic about incorporating features into the remote control, such as a volume control and a power indicator.
