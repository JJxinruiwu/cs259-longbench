[ANSWER]
The project manager's perspective on the prototype is negative, citing issues such as high costs, poor design, lack of functionality, and unrealistic expectations. The project manager expresses frustration with the team's lack of creativity, poor design decisions, and failure to address concerns about cost, functionality, and user experience. The project manager also expresses disappointment with the team's inability to meet deadlines, and their frustration with the team's unrealistic expectations and poor communication.
