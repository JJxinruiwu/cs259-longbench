And how does HEFCW balance its funding for research and innovation with the need to be competitive in the UK and EU funding mechanisms? Dr David Blaney: The allocation is going to help us improve universities' ability to access funding from UKRI, and to get funding from other UK and EU funding sources. So, that's the goal. We are using our funding to address some of the major challenges in the sector, such as the impact of Brexit and the need for increased investment in our research capacity. So, the funding is going to improve universities' ability to respond to the challenges facing research in the sector. And, the UKRI funding will actually allow universities to be more competitive in the EU funding mechanism. So, that's the real point of the funding. [Inaudible.]

[QUESTION]
Do you have any confidence that there won't be any further increases in fee increases for part-time students in the next two or three years? Dr David Blaney: I don't think so, and I think there's a likelihood that there will be more in the high-risk category. That's the challenge.

[QUESTION]
Would your remit letter for 2019-20 provide enough support for innovation in the sector? Dr David Blaney: Our remit letter was designed to place funding back into the system for innovation, but we need to do more. We're currently in train in terms of what we're doing. So, we need more work on how to apply that funding.

[QUESTION]
Do you believe that the current funding structure for research and innovation in the sector is competitive, and would you recommend any changes to the structure? Dr David Blaney: I think that's a difficult question. There are some elements of the current structure that are good, but I think it needs some tweaking. The main issue is that it's too spread out across the sector, and there needs to be more focus on universities that are struggling. I think there should be more incentives for universities to focus on these areas. And there needs to be more support for universities that are struggling, rather than leaving them to fend for themselves. Dr David Blaney: We're looking at a number of options, including reducing the number of EU funding bodies, and creating some sort of additional funding for universities that are struggling. That would be a great start. So, I think we're on the right track.

Have you seen a shift in the way that funding is being used in the sector? Dr David Blaney: There's been
