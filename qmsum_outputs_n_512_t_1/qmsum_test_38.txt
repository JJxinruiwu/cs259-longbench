[ANSWER]
The user interface designer proposed designing remote controls with features that are currently fashionable, such as having a titanium smell like fruit, spongy, or fruity shapes. They also suggested exploring the idea of having a double-curved shape like bananas or other fruits. Additionally, they proposed designing remote controls with advanced features such as speech recognition, fingerprint recognition, or light-emitting capabilities. 

However, the designer also mentioned that if these features are too complex or expensive, they might be less likely to be adopted by consumers. 

The designer's ideas were met with some skepticism by the project manager, but the designer remained optimistic about the potential for innovation in the remote control industry. 

In the end, the project manager and the designer agreed to explore the idea of titanium and spongy shapes as options for the remote controls, as well as the idea of having advanced features like speech recognition and light-emitting capabilities. 

Overall, the discussion about industrial components highlighted the importance of considering the user experience and the latest trends in consumer electronics when designing remote controls.
