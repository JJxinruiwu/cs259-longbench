Was it reasonable to suggest that £4.50 would be sufficient, given the evidence and experience with other childcare services in England and Wales?

Huw Irranca-Davies AM: Absolutely. We did consider £4.50 as an option. However, in terms of affordability, we also considered the cost of living in Wales, where the cost of a day's out in local shops is higher than in other parts of England, and the cost of a week's transport to school. Given those circumstances, I think it's more reasonable to suggest £5.00-£6.00 per day as the effective rate for children.

Is the evidence and experience of other childcare services in England and Wales sufficient to support the £4.50 hourly rate, and does it take into account the complexity of the Welsh childcare market?

How would you make sure that the Welsh Government's childcare offer aligns with the Childcare (Wales) Act 2014?

Huw Irranca-Davies AM: I think that's an area where we need to improve, and I'm committed to making sure that the Welsh Government's childcare offer aligns with the Childcare (Wales) Act 2014. We need to make sure that the offer is compliant with the act, and that we're not providing any services that are not mentioned in the act.

[QUESTION]
How do you see the proposed childcare offer potentially influencing the Welsh Government's efforts to tackle poverty?

Huw Irranca-Davies AM: I think it's likely to have a positive impact on the Welsh Government's efforts to tackle poverty. By providing a universal offer of childcare, we're helping to give
