The system is supposed to implement a belief-net and will need to provide a parser, analyzer, and generator for the English and German languages.

The system will need to:

* Parse input text to extract relevant information
* Analyze this information to determine the semantic meaning
* Generate output text based on the semantic meaning
* Provide a working system demonstration

The system will be used in a group project with Keith, a student in computer science, and John, another student in computer science. The system will be used to model and evaluate a hypothetical smartkom project, and will be used to create a working system demonstration for the demonstration. The system will also be used to develop a working version of the system, which will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the system in modeling and generating the desired output.

The system will be developed using object-oriented programming and will be built on top of existing systems. The system will be implemented using a combination of natural language processing and computer science techniques, including parsing, analysis, and generation. The system will be used to create a working system demonstration that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the system in modeling and generating the desired output.

The system will be implemented in a version control system and will be tested using a variety of evaluation metrics, including accuracy, fluency, and coherence. The system will be used to develop a working version of the system that can be used to model and generate the desired output.

The system will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the system in modeling and generating the desired output, and will be used to develop a working system demonstration that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the system.
