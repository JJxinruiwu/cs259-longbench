The meeting was called to discuss the following agenda items:
- 4 agenda items requested by Jane
- 1 agenda item involving transcription status
- 1 agenda item on disk issues
- 1 agenda item on tandem recognition system
- 1 agenda item on embedded training
- 1 agenda item on front-end features

The meeting involved:
- Grad A presenting on the status of the tandem recognition system
- Prof. B presenting on the transcription status
- Prof. F presenting on the disk issues
- Prof. D discussing the use of tandem recognition and embedded training
- Grad A responding to questions and addressing concerns about the tandem recognition system

The meeting concluded with Grad A stating that the system was "almost there" and that the next step would be to train the network.

Some key points from the meeting included:
- The tandem recognition system was being developed using the MIP protocol and the HLAA recognition architecture.
- The use of hidden units in the network was expected to provide a more efficient representation of the input data.
- The network was expected to improve performance on tasks such as recognition and text-to-speech synthesis.
- The embedded training of the network was expected to provide an improvement in performance on tasks such as recognition and text-to-speech synthesis.
- The front-end features of the network were expected to provide an improvement in performance on tasks such as text-to-speech synthesis.

Overall, the meeting discussed the progress of the tandem recognition system and the potential for improvements in performance on various tasks using embedded training.
