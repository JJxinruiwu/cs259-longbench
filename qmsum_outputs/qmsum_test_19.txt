Professor E: So. OK. Doesn't look like it crashed. That's great.
Grad G: So I think maybe what's causing it to crash is I keep starting it and then stopping it to see if it's working. And so I think starting it and then stopping it and starting it again causes it to crash. So, I won't do that anymore.
Postdoc B: And it looks like you've found a way of uh mapping the location to the {disfmarker} without having people have to give their names each time?
PhD A: Sounds like an initialization thing.
Postdoc B: I mean it's like you have the {disfmarker} So you know that {disfmarker}
Grad G: No.
Postdoc B: I mean, are you going to write down {pause} that I sat here?
Grad G: I'm gonna collect the digit forms and write it down.
Postdoc B: OK.
PhD C: Oh, OK.
Grad G: So {disfmarker} So they should be right with what's on the digit forms. OK, so I 'll go ahead and start with digits. u And I should say that uh, you just pau you just read each line an and then pause briefly.
Professor E: And start by giving the transcript number.
PhD A: Tran
PhD D: Transcript {disfmarker} Uh. OK, OK.
PhD A: Oh sorry, go ahead.
Professor E: So uh, you see, Don, the unbridled excitement of the work that we have on this project.
Grad H: OK.
Professor E: It's just uh {disfmarker}
Grad H: Umh.
Professor E: Uh, you know, it doesn't seem like a bad idea to have {comment} that information.
Grad G: And I'm surprised I sort of {disfmarker} I'm surprised I forgot that,
Professor E: Yeah, I {disfmarker} I 'd {disfmarker} I think it's some
Grad G: but uh I think that would be a good thing to add. After I just printed out a zillion of them.
Professor E: Yeah, well, that's {disfmarker} Um, so I {disfmarker} I do have a {disfmarker} a an agenda suggestion. Uh, we {disfmarker} I think the things that we talk about in this meeting uh tend to be a mixture of uh procedural uh mundane things and uh research points and um I was thinking I think it was a meeting a couple of weeks ago that we {disfmarker} we spent much of the time talking about the mundane stuff cuz that's easier to get out of the way and then we sort of drifted into the research and maybe five minutes into that Andreas had to leave. So {vocalsound} uh I'm suggesting we turn it around and {disfmarker} and uh sort of we have {disfmarker} anybody has some mundane points that we could send an email later, uh hold them for a bit, and let's talk about the {disfmarker} the research - y kind of things. Um, so um the one th one thing I know that we have on that is uh we had talked a {disfmarker} a couple weeks before um uh about the uh {disfmarker} the stuff you were doing with {disfmarker} with uh um uh l l attempting to locate events, we had a little go around trying to figure out what you meant by " events " but I think, you know, what we had meant by " events " I guess was uh points of overlap between speakers. But I th I gather from our discussion a little earlier today that you also mean uh interruptions with something else
PhD D: Yeah.
Professor E: like some other noise.
PhD D: Uh - huh. Yeah.
Professor E: Yes? You mean that as an event also.
PhD D: To
Professor E: So at any rate you were {disfmarker} you've {disfmarker} you've done some work on that
PhD D: right.
Professor E: and um then the other thing would be it might be nice to have a preliminary discussion of some of the other uh research uh areas that uh we're thinking about doing. Um, I think especially since you {disfmarker} you haven't been in {disfmarker} in these meetings for a little bit, maybe you have some discussion of some of the p the plausible things to look at now that we're starting to get data, uh and one of the things I know that also came up uh is some discussions that {disfmarker} that uh {disfmarker} that uh Jane had with Lokendra uh about some {disfmarker} some {disfmarker} some um uh work about I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I d I {disfmarker} I don't want to try to say cuz I {disfmarker} I 'll say it wrong, but anyway some {disfmarker} some potential collaboration there about {disfmarker} about the {disfmarker} about the {disfmarker} working with these data.
PhD C: Oh. Sure.
Professor E: So. So, uh.
Grad G: You wanna just go around?
Professor E: Uh. {pause} Well, I don't know if we {disfmarker} if this is sort of like everybody has something to contribute sort of thing, I think there's just just a couple {disfmarker} a couple people primarily um but um Uh, wh why don't {disfmarker} Actually I think that {disfmarker} that last one I just said we could do fairly quickly so why don't you {disfmarker} you start with that.
Postdoc B: OK. Shall I {disfmarker} shall I just start? OK.
Professor E: Yeah, just explain what it was.
Postdoc B: Um, so, uh, he was interested in the question of {disfmarker} you know, relating to his {disfmarker} to the research he presented recently, um of inference structures, and uh, the need to build in, um, this {disfmarker} this sort of uh mechanism for understanding of language. And he gave the example in his talk about how {pause} um, e a I'm remembering it just off the top of my head right now, but it's something about how um, i " Joe slipped " you know, " John had washed the floor " or something like that. And I don't have it quite right, but that kind of thing, where you have to draw the inference that, OK, there's this time sequence, but also the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the causal aspects of the uh floor and {disfmarker} and how it might have been the cause of the fall and that um it was the other person who fell than the one who cleaned it and it {disfmarker} {comment} These sorts of things. So, I looked through the transcript that we have so far, {comment} and um, fou identified a couple different types of things of that type and um, one of them was something like uh, during the course of the transcript, um um, w we had gone through the part where everyone said which channel they were on and which device they were on, and um, the question was raised " Well, should we restart the recording at this point? " And {disfmarker} and Dan Ellis said, " Well, we're just so far ahead of the game right now {pause} we really don't need to ". Now, how would you interpret that without a lot of inference? So, the inferences that are involved are things like, OK, so, how do you interpret " ahead of the game "? You know. So it's the {disfmarker} it's {pause} i What you {disfmarker} what you int what you draw {disfmarker} you know, the conclusions that you need to draw are that space is involved in recording,
Grad G: Hmm, metaphorically.
Postdoc B: that um, i that {pause} i we have enough space, and he continues, like " we're so ahead of the game cuz now we have built - in downsampling ". So you have to sort of get the idea that um, " ahead of the game " is sp speaking with respect to space limitations, that um that in fact downsampling is gaining us enough space, and that therefore we can keep the recording we've done so far. But there are a lot of different things like that.
Grad G: So, do you think his interest is in using this as {pause} a data source, or {pause} training material, or what?
Professor E: Well, I {disfmarker} I should maybe interject to say this started off with a discussion that I had with him, so um we were trying to think of ways that his interests could interact with ours
Grad G: Mm - hmm.
Professor E: and um uh I thought that if we were going to project into the future when we had a lot of data, uh and um such things might be useful for that in or before we invested too much uh effort into that he should uh, with Jane's help, look into some of the data that we're {disfmarker} already have and see, is there anything to this at all?
Grad G: Mm - hmm.
Professor E: Is there any point which you think that, you know, you could gain some advantage and some potential use for it. Cuz it could be that you 'd look through it and you say " well, this is just the wrong {pause} task for {disfmarker} for him to pursue his {disfmarker} "
Grad G: Wrong, yeah.
Professor E: And {disfmarker} and uh I got the impression from your mail that in fact there was enough things like this just in the little sample that {disfmarker} that you looked at that {disfmarker} that it's plausible at least.
Postdoc B: It's possible. Uh, he was {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} you know {disfmarker} We met and he was gonna go and uh you know, y look through them more systematically
Professor E: Yeah.
Postdoc B: and then uh meet again.
Professor E: Yeah.
Postdoc B: So it's, you know, not a matter of a {disfmarker}
Professor E: Yeah.
Postdoc B: But, yeah, I think {disfmarker} I think it was optimistic.
Professor E: So anyway, that's {disfmarker} that's e a quite different thing from anything we've talked about that, you know, might {disfmarker} might {disfmarker} might come out from some of this.
PhD C: But he can use text, basically. I mean, he's talking about just using text
Postdoc B: That's his major {disfmarker} I mentioned several that w had to do with implications drawn from intonational contours
PhD C: pretty much, or {disfmarker}?
Postdoc B: and {pause} that wasn't as directly relevant to what he's doing. He's interested in these {disfmarker} these knowledge structures,
PhD C: OK.
PhD D: Yeah, interesting.
Postdoc B: inferences that you draw {pause} i from {disfmarker}
Professor E: I mean, he certainly could use text, but we were in fact looking to see if there {disfmarker} is there {disfmarker} is there something in common between our interest in meetings and his interest in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in this stuff. So.
Grad G: And I imagine that transcripts of speech {disfmarker} I mean text that is speech {disfmarker} probably has more of those than sort of prepared writing. I {disfmarker} I don't know whether it would or not, but it seems like it would.
Professor E: I don't know, probably de probably depends on what the prepared writing was. But.
Postdoc B: Yeah, I don't think I would make that leap, because i in narratives, you know {disfmarker} I mean, if you spell out everything in a narrative, it can be really tedious,
Grad G: Mm - hmm.
Postdoc B: so.
Grad G: Yeah, I'm just thinking, you know, when you're {disfmarker} when you're face to face, you have a lot of backchannel and {disfmarker} And {disfmarker}
Postdoc B: Oh. That aspect.
Grad G: Yeah. And so I think it's just easier to do that sort of broad inference jumping if it's face to face. I mean, so, if I just read that Dan was saying " we're ahead of the game " {comment} in that {disfmarker} in that context,
Postdoc B: Well {disfmarker} Yeah.
Grad G: I might not realize that he was talking about disk space as opposed to anything else.
Postdoc B: I {disfmarker} you know, I {disfmarker} I had several that had to do with backchannels and this wasn't one of them.
Grad G: Uh - huh.
Postdoc B: This {disfmarker} this one really does um m make you leap from {disfmarker} So he said, you know, " we're ahead of the game, w we have built - in downsampling ".
Grad G: Mm - hmm.
Postdoc B: And the inference, i if you had it written down, would be {disfmarker}
Grad G: I guess it would be the same.
Postdoc B: Uh - huh. But there are others that have backchannelling, it's just he was less interested in those.
PhD F: Can I {disfmarker} Sorry to interrupt. Um, I f f f I've {disfmarker} @ @ {comment} d A minute {disfmarker} uh, several minutes ago, I, like, briefly was {disfmarker} was not listening and {disfmarker} So who is " he " in this context?
PhD C: Yeah, there's a lot of pronoun {disfmarker}
PhD F: OK. So I was just realizing we've {disfmarker} You guys have been talking about " he " um for at least uh, I don't know, three {disfmarker} three four minutes without ever mentioning the person's name again.
PhD C: I believe it. Yeah. Actually to make it worse, {comment} uh, Morgan uses " you " and " you "
PhD F: So this is {disfmarker} this is {disfmarker} this is {disfmarker} gonna be a big, big problem if you want to later do uh, you know, indexing, or speech understanding of any sort.
Grad G: It's in my notes.
PhD C: with gaze and no identification, or {disfmarker} I just wrote this down. Yeah, actually. Cuz Morgan will say well, " you had some ideas "
PhD D: Yeah.
PhD F: You just wrote this?
PhD C: and he never said Li - He looked {disfmarker}
Grad G: Well, I think he's doing that intentionally,
PhD C: Right, so it's great.
Grad G: aren't you?
PhD C: So this is really great
PhD F: Right.
PhD C: because the thing is, because he's looking at the per even for addressees in the conversation,
PhD D: Yeah.
PhD F: Mm - hmm.
PhD C: I bet you could pick that up in the acoustics. Just because your gaze is also correlated with the directionality of your voice.
Professor E: Uh - huh. Could be.
Postdoc B: Can we
Professor E: Yeah. That would be tou
Grad G: Oh, that would be interesting.
PhD C: Yeah, so that, I mean, to even know um when {disfmarker}
PhD D: Yeah.
PhD C: Yeah, if you have the P Z Ms you should be able to pick up what a person is looking at from their voice.
Grad G: Well, especially with Morgan, with the way we have the microphones arranged. I'm sort of right on axis and it would be very hard to tell.
PhD C: Right.
Grad G: Uh.
Postdoc B: Oh, but you 'd have the {disfmarker}
PhD C: Put Morgan always like this
Postdoc B: You 'd have fainter {disfmarker}
PhD C: and {disfmarker}
Postdoc B: Wouldn't you get fainter reception out here?
Professor E: Well, these {disfmarker}
Grad G: Sure, but I think if I'm talking like this? Right now I'm looking at Jane and talking, now I'm looking at Chuck and talking, I don't think the microphones would pick up that difference.
PhD C: But you don't have this {disfmarker} this problem.
Postdoc B: I see.
PhD C: Morgan is the one who does this most.
Grad G: So if I'm talking at you, or I'm talking at you.
Professor E: I probably been affect No, I th I think I've been affected by too many conversations where we were talking about lawyers and talking about {disfmarker} and concerns about " oh gee is somebody going to say something bad? " and so on.
Grad G: Lawyers.
Professor E: And so I {disfmarker} so I'm {disfmarker} I'm tending to stay away from people's names even though uh {disfmarker}
Postdoc B: I am too.
PhD C: Even though you could pick up later on, just from the acoustics who you were t who you were looking at.
Postdoc B: I am too.
Grad G: And we did mention who " he " was.
PhD C: Yeah.
Professor E: Yeah.
PhD F: Right, but I missed it.
Grad G: Early in the conversation.
PhD F: But {disfmarker} it was uh {disfmarker}
PhD C: Yeah, yeah.
Professor E: Yeah.
Grad G: Do {disfmarker} Sh - Can I say
Professor E: Yeah. No no, there's {disfmarker}
PhD F: Yeah.
Grad G: or {disfmarker} or is that just too sensitive?
Professor E: No no, it isn't sensitive at all.
Postdoc B: Well {disfmarker}
Professor E: I was just {disfmarker} I was just {disfmarker} I was overreacting just because we were having {disfmarker} a conversation.
Grad G: Mm - hmm.
Postdoc B: I think it's because you {disfmarker} you are so used to being in the {disfmarker} and you think you can {disfmarker} you know, but this is not the same.
Grad G: I think that's probably right.
Postdoc B: I mean, it's not like you {disfmarker} you are used to being in a {disfmarker} and you think you know what to do, but this is not the same.
Grad G: Yeah.
Postdoc B: So maybe it's because you are {disfmarker} you are {disfmarker}
Professor E: Yeah, I think it's because we were having a conversation about something that's a bit too sensitive, and I was getting a little {disfmarker} and I was worried that maybe the other person might be offended.
Grad
