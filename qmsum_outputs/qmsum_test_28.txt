Grad A: OK, we're on.
Professor B: Yeah.
Grad A: So, I think this is gonna be a pretty short meeting because I have four agenda items, three of them were requested by Jane who is not gonna be at the meeting today.  So. {vocalsound} The uh first was transcription status. Does anyone besides Jane know what the transcription status is?
PhD F: Um, sort of, I do, peripherally.
PhD C: Is that English?
PhD F: Um {disfmarker} Well first of all with IBM I got a note from Brian yesterday saying that they finally made the tape for the thing that we sent them a {pause} week or week and a half ago
PhD D: That's our system.
Grad A: Ugh!
PhD F: and that it's gone out to the transcribers and hopefully next week we 'll have the transcription back from that.
Grad A: C can I have a pen?
PhD F: Um {disfmarker} Jane seems to be um moving right along on the transcriptions from the ICSI side. She's assigned, I think probably five or six m more meetings.
PhD C: Yeah, I think we're up to MR thirteen or something.
PhD D: Mmm.
PhD F: Yeah, so um, I guess she's hired some new transcribers
PhD D: Speaking {disfmarker}
Grad E: Which meetings is she transcribing?
PhD F: and {disfmarker} Um well we've {disfmarker} we've run out of E D Us because a certain number of them are um, sort of awaiting to go to IBM.
Grad E: OK.
PhD C: For IBM, yeah.
PhD D: Hmm.
Grad E: OK.
PhD F: and the rest are in process being transcribed uh here.
PhD D: So does she have transcribers right now who are basically sitting idle because there's no data back from IBM
Grad E: So we're doing some in parallel.
Grad A: Yep.
PhD F: No.
Grad A: No, no.
PhD F: Oh no no.
Grad A: We haven't done that process.
PhD D: no?
PhD F: No. We're not waiting on them.
Grad A: So. They'r they're doing the full transcription process.
PhD D: Oh. Oh, OK.
Grad E: So they're just doing their own thing until {disfmarker}
PhD F: Yeah.
PhD D: Because I {disfmarker} I need to ask Jane whether it's {disfmarker} it would be OK for her {disfmarker} um, s some of her people to transcribe uh some of the initial data we got from the SmartKom data collection, which is these short like five or seven minute sessions.
PhD F: We're doing it in parallel, yeah.
Grad E: OK.
PhD C: Yep.
PhD D: Um and we want it {disfmarker} You know, we need {disfmarker} The {disfmarker} Again, we {disfmarker} we have a similar uh logistic set - up where we are supposed to send the data to Munich
Grad A: Right.
PhD D: and get it transcribed and get it back. But to get going we would like some of the data transcribed right away so we can get started.
Grad A: Yep, sounds familiar.
PhD D: And so um I wanted to ask Jane if {disfmarker} if uh, you know, maybe one of their transcribers could {disfmarker} could do {disfmarker} I mean since these are very short, that should really be uh,
Professor B: Mm - hmm.
PhD D: um {disfmarker} It's {disfmarker}
PhD C: There's only two channels. So it's only {disfmarker} Yeah.
PhD D: Yeah.
PhD C: As the synthesis doesn't have to be transcribed I think.
PhD D: It's only two {disfmarker} Right, s
PhD C: So.
PhD D: Yeah. So {disfmarker} So it's basically one channel to transcribe. And it's {disfmarker} One session is only uh like seven {disfmarker}
Professor B: So that should have ma many fewer {disfmarker} And it's also not uh a bunch of interruptions with people and all that,
PhD D: Right. And some of it is read speech, so we could give them the {disfmarker} the thing that they're reading
Professor B: right? So. Yeah.
PhD D: and they just may {disfmarker}
Grad A: Make sure it's right.
PhD C: Yep.
PhD D: And so um, um, I guess since she's {disfmarker} I was gonna ask her but since she's not around I {disfmarker} maybe I 'll {disfmarker}
Professor B: Yeah, well it certainly seems {disfmarker}
PhD D: Uh if {disfmarker} if that's OK with you to {disfmarker} to, you know, get that stuff uh {disfmarker} to ask her for that, then I 'll do that.
Professor B: Yeah. Yeah, if we're held up on this other stuff a little bit in order to encompass that, that's OK because I I um, I mean I still have high hopes that the that the IBM pipeline 'll work out for us, so it's {disfmarker}
PhD D: Yeah. OK, yeah.
Professor B: Yeah.
PhD D: Alrighty.
PhD F: Oh, yeah, and also related to the transcription stuff, so I've been trying to keep a web page uh up to date f showing what the current status is of the trans of all the things we've collected and what stage each meeting is in, in terms of whether it's {disfmarker}
Grad A: Can you mail that out to the list?
PhD F: Mm - hmm, yeah I will. I {disfmarker} That's the thing that I sent out just to foo people saying can you update these pages
Grad A: Oh, OK, OK.
PhD F: and so that's where I'm putting it but I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll send it out to the list telling people to look at it.
Grad A: Yeah, I haven't done that. So. I have lots of stuff to add that's just in my own directory.
PhD F: Yeah.
Grad A: I 'll try to get to that. OK. So Jane also wanted to talk about participant approval, but I don't really think there's much to talk about. I'm just gonna do it. And uh, if anyone objects too much then they can do it instead.
Professor B: You are going to {disfmarker}
Grad A: I'm gonna send out to the participants, uh, with links to web pages which contain the transcripts and allow them to {pause} suggest edits. And then bleep them out.
Professor B: OK.
Grad A: For the ones that we have. Um {disfmarker}
PhD C: So but it's just transcripts, not the {disfmarker} not the audio?
Grad A: Nope, they 'll have access to the audio also.
PhD C: OK, yeah, yep. Ah.
Grad A: I mean that's my intention. Because the transcripts might not be right.
PhD C: Yeah.
PhD F: So {disfmarker}
Grad A: So you want people to be able to listen to them.
PhD C: Yeah.
PhD F: So, um the audio that they're gonna have access to, will that be the uncompressed version? Or will you have scripts that like uncompress the various pieces and {disfmarker}
Grad A: Oh, that's a good point. That's a good point. Yeah, it's {disfmarker} it's probably going to have to be the uncompressed versions because, uh, uh, it takes too long to do random access decompression.
PhD F: Hmm. Yeah, I was just wondering because we're uh running out of the un - backed - up disk space on
Grad A: Well, that was the other point.
PhD F: Oh, was that another one?
Grad A: Yep, that's another agenda item.
PhD F: OK. I 'll wait.
Grad A: So, uh {disfmarker} But that is a good point so we 'll get to that, too. Um, DARPA demo status, not much to say. The back - end stuff is working out fine. It's more or less ready to go. I've added some stuff that uh indes indexes by the meeting type MR, EDU, et cetera and also by the user ID. So that the front - end can then do filtering based on that as well. Uh {disfmarker} The back - end is uh, going more slowly as I s I think I said before just cuz I'm not much of a Tcl - TK programmer. And uh Dave Gelbart says he's a little too busy. So I think Don and I are gonna work on that and {disfmarker} and you and I can just talk about it off - line more.
Grad E: Right.
Grad A: But uh {pause} the back - end was pretty smooth.
Professor B: Oh
Grad A: So I think, we 'll have something. It may not be as {disfmarker} As pretty as we might like, but we 'll have something.
Professor B: I wondered whe when we would reach Dave's saturation point. He's sort of been {disfmarker} been volunteering for everything
Grad A: Yeah.
Professor B: and {pause} and uh {disfmarker}
PhD D: Mm - hmm.
Professor B: O K. Finally said he was too busy. I guess we reached it.
Grad A: Yeah, he {disfmarker} he actually {disfmarker} he volunteered but then he s then he retracted it. So. Oh well. Um {disfmarker}
Grad E: And, also um, I was just showing Andreas, I got um an X Waves kind of display, and I don't know how much more we can do with it {disfmarker} with like the prosodic stuff where we have like stylized pitches and signals and the transcripts on the bottom
Grad A: Oh, cool.
Grad E: so, right now it's just an X Waves and then you have three windows but I don't know, it looked pretty nice and I'm sure it {disfmarker} think it has potential for a little something,
Grad A: For a demo?
Grad E: yeah, for a demo.
Grad A: Yeah, sounds good.
Grad E: So {disfmarker}
Professor B: OK, so again, the issue is {disfmarker} For July, the issue's gonna be what can we fit into a Windows machine, uh, and so on, but {disfmarker}
Grad E: Oh. OK.
Grad A: So it might just be slides.
Grad E: Yeah, OK.
PhD C: Well {disfmarker} {pause} Yeah.
Grad E: Well, we 'll see, um {disfmarker}
PhD C: I've been putting together uh Transcriber things for Windows so i And I installed it on Dave Gelbart's PC and it worked just fine. So hopefully that will work.
PhD D: Really? So is that {disfmarker} Because there's some people um {disfmarker} It would be cool if we could uh get that to work uh at {disfmarker} at SRI
PhD C: Yeah. Yep.
PhD D: because the um {disfmarker}
Grad A: Well Transcriber is Tcl - TK, very generic with Snack,
PhD D: we have m m We have more Windows machines to run the {disfmarker}
PhD C: Yeah.
Grad A: so basically anything you can get Snack to run on, it will work.
PhD D: Right.
PhD C: Yeah. Yeah but {disfmarker} But the problem is the version Transcriber works with, the Snack version, is one point six whatever and that's not anymore supported. It's not on {disfmarker} on the web page anymore. But I just wrote an email to {disfmarker} to the author of {disfmarker} to the Snack author and he sent me to one point six whatever library
Grad A: Well I thought it was packaged with Transcriber?
PhD C: and so it works. Yeah, but then you can't add our patches and then the {disfmarker} the new version is {disfmarker} is totally different
Grad A: Oh.
PhD C: a and in {disfmarker} yeah, in terms of {disfmarker} of the source code.
Grad A: Ah.
PhD C: You {disfmarker} you can't find the Tcl files anymore. It's some whatever wrapped thing
PhD D: Mmm.
PhD C: and you can't {disfmarker} you can't access that so you have to install {disfmarker} First install Tcl then install Snack and then install the Transcriber thing and then do the patches.
Grad A: Patch. Ugh!
PhD D: I {disfmarker} I wonder if {disfmarker} if we should contribute our changes back to the authors so that they maintain those changes along {disfmarker}
PhD C: Yeah. Yeah.
Grad A: We have {disfmarker} Yeah b it's just hasn't made it into the release yet.
PhD D: We have? Oh. Oh, OK.
PhD F: So did you um put the uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the NT version out on the uh Meeting Recorder page? Or {disfmarker}
PhD C: No, I haven't done that yet. I'm {disfmarker} oh Nope. But I definitely will do that.
Professor B: So, can some of the stuff that Don's talking about somehow fit into this Uh, mean you just have a set of numbers that are associated with the {disfmarker}
Grad E: Yeah.
PhD C: So {disfmarker}
Grad E: Yeah, it's basically ASCII files or binary files, whatever representation. Just three different {disfmarker} It's a waveform and just a stylized pitch vector basically so it's {disfmarker}
PhD D: So {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker}
Grad E: I mean we could do it in Matl - {comment} I mean you could do it in a number of different places I'm sure.
PhD D: But {disfmarker} But it would be cool if the Transcriber interface had like another window for the {disfmarker} you know, maybe above the waveform where it would show some arbitrary valued function that is {disfmarker} that is you know time synchron ti ti time synchronous with the wavform.
PhD C: Yep.
Grad E: Yeah.
Professor B: Yes.
Grad E: Yeah, that 'd be very cool.
Grad A: It 'd be easy enough to add that. Again it's {disfmarker} it's {pause} It's more Tcl - T
Grad E: Yeah.
Grad A: So someone who's familiar with Tcl - TK has to do it,
PhD D: Right.
Grad A: but uh, it wouldn't be hard to do.
PhD D: Right. But it would almost be like having another waveform displayed.
Grad A: Yep.
PhD C: Yep.
PhD D: S
Grad E: Mm - hmm.
PhD D: Right.
PhD C: Yeah. Yeah, maybe we could l look into that.
Grad E: Yeah.
Grad A: But it {disfmarker} it seems to me that I c
PhD C: And {disfmarker}
Grad A: It doesn't seem like having that real time is that necessary. So yo It seems to me you could do images.
Grad E: Um {pause} What do you mean by real time? Do you mean like {disfmarker}
PhD F: Like being able to scroll through it and stuff for the demo.
Grad E: OK.
Grad A: Yeah, jus Yeah.
PhD F: Is that what you mean?
Grad A: It just seems to me jus
Grad E: It would be cool to see it {disfmarker}
PhD F: Yeah.
Grad E: It would be cool like to see {disfmarker} to hear it and see it,
PhD C: And to hear it. Yeah. Yeah.
Grad E: and see the pitch contours also.
Grad A: Sure, but I don't think {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} You can do all that just statically in
PhD C: Yeah.
Grad E: I think it would lose {disfmarker} Yeah, I mean y
Grad A: Just record the audio clip and show an image and I think that's {disfmarker}
Grad E: Right, right. I just thought if you meant slides I thought you meant like just {pause} like {pause} um view graphs or something.
Professor B: You know, wh Yeah. So. Uh, no, we're talking about on the computer and {disfmarker} and um, I think when we were talking about this before we had littl this little demo meeting,
Grad E: Right.
Professor B: we sort of set up a range of different degrees of liveness that you could have and, {vocalsound} the more live, the better, but uh, given the crunch of time, we may have to retreat from it to some extent. So I think {disfmarker} {pause} For a lot of reasons, I think it would be very nice to have this Transcriber interface be able to show some other interesting signal along with it
PhD D: Mm - hmm.
Professor B: so it 'd be a good thing to get in there. But, um {disfmarker} Anyway, jus just looking for ways that we could actually show what you're doing, uh, in {disfmarker} {pause} to people.
Grad E: Mm - hmm.
Professor B: Cuz a lot of this stuff, particularly for Communicator, uh certainly a significant chunk of the things that we waved our arms about th originally had t had to do with prosodics, and the ability to hear the prosody, and so on.
Grad A: So, uh {disfmarker} So, what is the next step for the demo?
Grad E: Um {pause} Right.
PhD C: Well, we've talked about that. But I think the next step is to get some of the demo stuff out to the participants and to get feedback from them.
Grad A: Right.
PhD D: And then we can work on the rest of the demo.
Grad E: Yeah.
PhD C: And then we can try to get it out to the whole audience.
Grad A: Right.
PhD D: So we can see how it goes.
Grad E: Yeah.
Grad A: Yeah.
Grad E: So, uh {disfmarker} what is the next step?
PhD C: Well, I think we should get some of the demo stuff out to the participants and get feedback from them.
Grad A
