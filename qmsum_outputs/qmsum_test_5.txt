Project Manager: Okay. So, now um, {vocalsound} last time. Can you uh {vocalsound} push the button? {vocalsound} One time please. So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I'm still the secretary. Now uh, I ask you to presentate the prototype. One of your {disfmarker} you two.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: I don't care. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Oh this, you mean?

Industrial Designer: Huh?
User Interface: Yes, well uh this is it. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}

Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: the sides.
Project Manager: Yes.
User Interface: And the rest is hard plastic. And uh {disfmarker} We uh we had some uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} We had a new idea {vocalsound} that that this can uh can be uh uh turned inside.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: And then it covers the {disfmarker} these buttons
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: until here or something.
Marketing: Yes.
User Interface: And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: So, you can still operate uh all the things. Because you don't always use the menu. And then it can break.
Project Manager: Okay. And the buttons?
User Interface: Uh, well uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Big. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Big buttons. And everything is blue, except the power button. And the mute. Of uh {disfmarker} yeah, and the mute and the the other button. {vocalsound} Yeah. Channel higher channel button.
Industrial Designer: {gap}.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: And the joystick is for the volume and the channels.
User Interface: Uh, yes. Yes,
Industrial Designer: Yes.
User Interface: that's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Very obvious.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Up is channel up. Down is channel down. To the right is volume up. To the left is volume down.
User Interface: Yeah.
Project Manager: Okay, so if joystick and L_C_D_. What's the R_R_ {gap} d {vocalsound}
User Interface: R_R_'s the l the the the the company uh logo.

User Interface: Uh, yes. Yes. That's about here.
Project Manager: So, what they say on the side is put fashion there. Yes. It's good.
User Interface: Oh.
Project Manager: So, that's it. That's prototype.
Marketing: Yeah?
Project Manager: Now, the finance. {vocalsound} We don't know if it's {disfmarker} th it {disfmarker} if it's okay.
Marketing: Alright. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So, I'm gonna look.
Marketing: Do we {disfmarker}
Project Manager: We have {disfmarker}
Marketing: Do we change the {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Sorry?
Marketing: Do we change the the order? Or are we going to uh ev evaluate it first?
Project Manager: Finance is um {disfmarker} Yeah it's {disfmarker} No, first uh {disfmarker} Yes. We have to evaluate the product yet.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: Sorry.
Marketing: That's uh um {disfmarker} {gap} That can be none. Um, we gonna do the evaluation now, together. But I have uh a introduction how it works. So, it will come up. Uh-oh. Okay. Um, yeah. Well, we uh {disfmarker} uh, I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias, uh based on um our marketing strategy, on uh the latest trends, on user preferences. Uh, we have a seven point scale from uh true, as well. To false, seven? And on base of each c uh criteria, we need to um give a rating. We can uh {disfmarker} Well, it look like this. But we gonna uh do it here, they said. {vocalsound} So, you hope found out how to do it with a Word document. Yeah. Okay, yeah. Yeah. Um, well uh we have the Word document
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Criteria.
Marketing: You {disfmarker} {gap} So we open up that blank here. Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Think I can {disfmarker} Uh, what this just an example. So, this not very important. But um, if I can get a number in here. Hmm.
Project Manager: No, it's okay.
Marketing: Well, uh we can't do that.
Industrial Designer: I'll get it.
Project Manager: Oh, it's okay.
Marketing: Um, so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative. Uh, and then we have to uh agree on the rating together. And in the end, we will c uh count an average of all rating. The first uh on each item.
Project Manager: What do you think?
Marketing: Yeah, I think it's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh, well technologically using, it's not uh {disfmarker} it doesn't contain many new features. Only the L_C_D_. So, it {disfmarker} Um, I think I will give it a {disfmarker} yeah, yeah, yeah {gap}, a four. Hmm.
Industrial Designer: I think the scroll-button is something also uh new. What uh {disfmarker} not anoth uh,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: not a lot of uh {disfmarker} a lot of uh remote controls have. I think technologically I'll give it an seven. Si six six.
Project Manager: {gap} Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Sorry, six.
Marketing: So now i I think you uh see it {gap} um its statement.
Industrial Designer: Oh, true or false.
Marketing: And you {gap} true or false.
Industrial Designer: Oh, uh I'll I'll give it uh a t a two.
Marketing: And true is one. So, yeah. Yeah.
Project Manager: Two.
Industrial Designer: Sorry.
Project Manager: You?
User Interface: Three.
Project Manager: Me too. So it's a three.
Marketing: 'Kay. Um, well {disfmarker} It's a one. {vocalsound} The first item. So, okay the second item. Um, this product is for all sorts of customers.
User Interface: Mm {disfmarker}
Marketing: Well, it's a statement which uh I disagree with, because we uh really aim uh at at young market and I think the way it looked uh c uh totally in yellow, it's not uh really aimed for all customers. It doesn't look like that.
Project Manager: So it's a {disfmarker}
Marketing: That's uh a six.
Industrial Designer: Five.
User Interface: Mm, four.
Project Manager: Yes, it's for the younger g group. So it's uh half half of the people.
User Interface: Yeah, but it's it's {disfmarker}
Project Manager: So I think it's four.
User Interface: Yeah. I mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons.
Project Manager: No.
User Interface: So {disfmarker} I mean, the colours are for young people,
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: but
Project Manager: Yes. So, I think it's four.
User Interface: older {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Maybe version uh three point O_ uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} has other colours. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah. Maybe.
Project Manager: Okay. Give it a four.
Industrial Designer: Four.
Project Manager: Yep.
Marketing: Four. Uh, okay. Mm.
Project Manager: We put the fashion in electronics.
Marketing: That's uh the motto of our company. Yeah, well do we do this with uh this product? I um {disfmarker} Yeah. I think if we do this, as it's uh uh c uh it's really orientates on the design. Um, so I would give it a two.
Industrial Designer: Me too a two, because only the battery is not uh techin uh technologically high standard. But the rest of it is. So, I think a two.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yes. Two.
Project Manager: Uh, I say uh a five.
Marketing: Two.
Project Manager: It's not fashion, it's new. It must be a fashion. But it isn't.
Industrial Designer: It {disfmarker} it will be fashion.
Project Manager: Yes. It w If it's not a fashion we can put it in it. So, it must be a fashion. I think it's a five.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay.
User Interface: Then make it th three.
Marketing: Okay. Yes, I'll think of that too.
Project Manager: No. Oh.
Industrial Designer: 'Kay. Three is okay.
Marketing: Yeah, agree?
Project Manager: I use my feet though. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh, we'll wait outside.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} A three.
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah okay.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: The next element um is the product looks good. Well personally, I do not prefer a um remote control that's fully in yellow. So, I would give this a five.
Industrial Designer: I give it a one. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {gap}. Yes, a one. I like it.
Project Manager: Well, I say three. So, counting then is two and a half. {vocalsound}
Marketing: We have to do our uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Say two.
Marketing: Two or three?
Project Manager: Okay, two.
Industrial Designer: Two.
Marketing: Two. Okay.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: So, well we gonna do the next part. Uh, yep. Uh uh, the next statement. It has not too much buttons. Um, yeah, I I have uh said is not because uh a low number is better. And in the end we calculate an average. So, um that's why it's a negative in it. Um, well this one of our aims not have too much buttons. So, um uh did we uh do that? Well, uh if we go to {vocalsound} uh this fashion, I {disfmarker} We still have caused uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers. But you can you can go for that. And um that way, you don't have a lot of buttons over. So, I would give this a two.
Industrial Designer: One.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} You?
User Interface: One. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Me too. One.
Marketing: One. {vocalsound} Um, but {vocalsound} where where is the {gap}?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Next, six. It does not get lost easily.
Marketing: So {disfmarker} Yeah, did we implement uh the sound?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yes. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Just a small thing. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: No, we did not. So, but can it get lost if it's such a thing?
User Interface: Yeah, but uh {disfmarker} Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Ah. Yellow.
Project Manager: I don't think so.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Looks like a pistol.
Project Manager: Yes. Not a not a normal shapes. So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} It won't get between uh the pillows uh on the couch.
Project Manager: No. It won't get lost.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: It won't.
Project Manager: A one? {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, o one.
Project Manager: Okay, a one.
Marketing: One.
Project Manager: Next.
Marketing: Okay, um well we aimed for the younger market.
Project Manager: {gap}
Marketing: Uh yeah, did we achieve that. I think with the way it looks and um it is designed, I will give it a two.
Project Manager: Yeah me {disfmarker} {gap}
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Me too.
Project Manager: That was our target. Two.
Industrial Designer: Two.
Project Manager: Yep.
Industrial Designer: Yeah? Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Right. There's a fancy look-and-feel.
Marketing: Uh, yes. That that was uh, yeah, one of the most important things that uh Trendwatch said. I didn't uh say it in my presentation. But um, well does it have that? I would say yes. So um {disfmarker} Well, let's also give this a two. T
Industrial Designer: I gave this a one because of the rubber. It feels soft. Uh, it looks like a l uh uh b uh, a bit like a joystick. It's {disfmarker} Yeah. Yeah, f very fancy {gap} trendy.
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: Yes, a one.
Project Manager: I say a two. It's a a bit personal. If it's fancy.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah.
Project Manager: So I think s two is better.
User Interface: Yeah, okay.
Industrial Designer: Two is okay.
Marketing: Okay. Two.
Industrial Designer: {gap}.
Marketing: And um, then the last one I could think of, uh it goes with the latest trends.
Project Manager: No, it's new. Innovation.
Marketing: If we looked at the latest trends for the uh younger people, and they ate uh fruit and vegetables, well it has a um a nice colour, uh well compared to food but we didn't uh {disfmarker} We did not paint any uh fruit and vegetable on it for something like that.
Industrial Designer: Oh.
Marketing: So, I would {disfmarker} did not give this uh a one or two. I {disfmarker} We'll go for a three.
Project Manager: {gap}.
Industrial Designer: I go for two because uh the the shapes are still round. Uh, the latest trends are soft things, you know, like uh I said in my presentation. Uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yes.
Industrial Designer: But the the colours are um basic, like yellow, red, um blue. Something what also younger people want. It's also a trend, so I'll give it a two.
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: Mm, three.
Project Manager: Me too. Three.
Marketing: A three.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: Okay. So um, come back to the presentation now. So, we find yourself there, and now we have to calculate an average rating.
Project Manager: Effort is three, ten and twelve. Thirty, forty, fifty, {gap}.
Marketing: So, we will do that. Yes.
Project Manager: Twenty one. So, it's uh two and three nine two and one third.
Marketing: By nine.
Industrial Designer: Two.
Marketing: Yeah. Um, uh okay. {vocalsound} Two.
Project Manager: Yep.
Marketing: Come on. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Uh, nah. Okay.
Marketing: So uh, that's a pretty low rating, I think.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yes.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So, it's good.
Marketing: So, according to our uh own evaluation uh we did a good job. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Thank you.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, I think {gap}.
Marketing: Oh. Nah. How am I doing? Yes.
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: And I closed your slide-show.
Project Manager: Back to my uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Which one was the last for you? Uh, dreaming.
Project Manager: Yep. Next please.
Marketing: Next. Finance.
Project Manager: So, now uh we have a product. Very happy. But uh, is it cheap enough? Um, so if uh {disfmarker} I'll have a look. We have a battery. One battery.
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Cheapest there is.
Project Manager: Okay, one battery. Electronics. Advanced chip.
Industrial Designer: Expensive.
Project Manager: Yeah it's the most advanced. Chip-on-print. We have that one.
Industrial Designer: Well, it's the most advanced.
Project Manager: We have the simple, regular and advanced.
Industrial Designer: Advanced.
Project Manager: We have the adva advanced. 'Kay, so uncurved or flat. Nope. Single curved or double curved? We have double curved. {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So it's got two curved sides.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So it's uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
