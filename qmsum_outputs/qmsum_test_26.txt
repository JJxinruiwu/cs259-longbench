Project Manager: Okay. {vocalsound} Well, let's start. What are we doing? Oops. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Hmm.
Industrial Designer: Ah, pinball.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay. Okay. Not doing.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm. Ah. Hey. {vocalsound} Ah.
Project Manager: Uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: Oh.
Marketing: Now I have my screen back too. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Very good.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} {gap} we have presentations. So first, it's your turn.
Industrial Designer: {gap}
User Interface: Mine. Oh, great.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah. Isn't it amazing. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Huh. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah. Very interesting.
User Interface: Uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Industrial Designer. Interface concept.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yes, well uh let's uh talk about the interface uh concept. Uh, first I'll uh I'll uh discuss the buttons we just chose, uh show you some samples, uh uh discuss some colours and design maybe, already. And uh my personal preferences. {vocalsound} Well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off. The bu uh the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off. The channels buttons, one to nine, and uh off uh uh zero to nine, and the uh button to choose uh higher channels than nine. Uh the volume and channel quadrants, uh left and right, up and down arrows, to uh do the volume and channel. And the menu menu button to man manipulate the L_C_D_ uh display. Um, I found some uh interesting uh uh samples. Examples.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Um, well uh what's pretty standard is uh that it's {disfmarker} that they're all pretty uh uh high uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Large.
User Interface: Yeah. Yeah. Large and and and pretty thin and uh and long.
Marketing: A lot {disfmarker} a lot of buttons buttons.
User Interface: Um, power buttons are mostly at the top uh left or right. Um, well we see the the the same uh arrows. Like there. And uh {disfmarker} Yeah, well arrow b buttons can be blue. And what's interesting is the the the icons on the buttons. Some buttons have icons like the play and stop, but we don't use that. But uh, these we we have to choose the right icons, or or letters. Uh this is the V_ for volume, but they're both uh a V_.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: So it's it's not really very uh clear what's the function of that.
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: Um {disfmarker} Yeah. So, that's {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Can you go back one page? For the uh menu, what do we use for that? We don't have buttons for the menu.
User Interface: Uh, well {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel {gap}.
User Interface: Yeah. I thought that was our uh idea.
Project Manager: Okay. But {gap} uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: So, uh how {disfmarker}
Project Manager: You have to put it on the {disfmarker}
User Interface: Like this.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Or or this. And that the menu button is okay.
Project Manager: Yeah but, has to be clear that you can use the arrows.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah, okay.
Marketing: Yes.
User Interface: Uh, so the {disfmarker} The icons on the arrows, as well, you mean.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Yes. The second one.
User Interface: Yeah. Uh, well that's something to uh think about. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Uh, maybe I'll have something in my uh presentation. And you will see it.
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: Okay. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Um, well I don't I don't know if we have to discuss this already, or in the next uh meeting.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: But uh, as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo, I would uh recommend a yellow case. Uh, round edges. The logo at the bottom. And uh, well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour. So, it's good. Uh, recognisable. K so, I think.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Not too much colours.
User Interface: Uh, no. Not too much.
Project Manager: No, it's not flower power.
User Interface: But uh {disfmarker} No, no, no. But this has to be has to be trendy and uh {disfmarker} and {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: S okay.
User Interface: Uh, yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons, and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh opinion.
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: That was that.
Project Manager: Thank you. So, you're next.
Industrial Designer: I'm next, okay. {vocalsound} Yes. No. Here we go.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Uh, at first we will uh I will f uh say something about what younger people want,
Marketing: {gap} Okay.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to. And then, I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs, about uh what battery is in it, what kind of buttons also. First uh, the younger people, they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours. Like, totally yellow, totally red. Uh, so it's visible. Uh, the shapes are curved and round, like uh you also said. Maybe it's nice to uh get a remote control not like all the other ones, straight and uh flat and long. But to give him the shape of your hand, so you {disfmarker} it's easier to use or something like that. But that's just an idea. And then, I'll have to discuss about the costs uh of all the things for the remote control. The battery, there are few options. Uh, I think the best option is to use uh the basic battery. So, everybody can buy it uh at the at the supermarket. Or use uh a k uh kinetic battery like uh within a watch. When you uh shake it a few times, it it's loaded. Uh, the the form of the remote control, I think it's also nice {gap} have it curved. And maybe like it's hand-shaped. Uh, so uh you take it here in your hand and here are the buttons. Uh material, you use plastic. Hard plastic uh because uh {gap} it won't have to burst uh like in the {disfmarker} in one time. And also rubber because the younger people like that, what we see in the research. Uh the push-buttons. We have one new thing uh discovered. It's a scroll push uh thing like a mouse. Maybe it's uh easy to use uh for the channels. When you want to go m move up, you just scroll up and click on the button, if you wanna see the next, uh if you wanna see that channel. And also for the mouse, uh for the volume, it's also uh easy to use. Just scroll a bit up, scroll a bit down. And that's also easy just w when you have a thing like this, and you get it here. You can do it with your thumb. And with your l left hand you can uh push the buttons
Marketing: Hmm.
Industrial Designer: uh if you {gap} push uh channel one, you can see channel one. The electrics um with a scroll push uh button, we must use regular uh chips. There are also uh simple chips. They are uh cheaper. Um, but then we have just a basic uh uh remote control, and I think there are a lot of those uh things, and people won't buy it any more. They have seen enough of it. And you have also advanced um chips. But that's with the L_C_D_ uh screen. And the costs will increase a lot more. And I think our budget is too low to use and an L_C_D_, and the chip who is more expensive. And maybe it's also then uh thoughtful if we u uh use uh as um different kind of uh shapes for the {disfmarker} for remote control, that we then use the primary colours. Like, you get a yellow uh remote control, red one, blue one, et cetera. You have any more questions about this? I think the main thing is we look at the costs.
Marketing: Yep.
Project Manager: Hmm.
Industrial Designer: And not too basic, not a basic remote control, who everybody already has.
Marketing: Yeah. But, thi i uh {disfmarker} This is with an L_C_D_? No,
Industrial Designer: Not with an L_C_D_.
Marketing: not.
Project Manager: No, isn't.
Industrial Designer: No.
Project Manager: But the L_C_D_ is easy when you use the scroll uh buttons. Then you can scroll, you see what number, and then you push.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. But then, what I say, the costs will uh get a lot higher.
Project Manager: But then it's not easy to use scroll uh wheel. If you don't {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Th then you'll see it on the television.
Project Manager: Hmm, yes. But then. Yeah, then you go one down one up. When you scroll.
Industrial Designer: but l when you see a menu uh on the television, it's like you see uh one to twenty, you go uh uh s scroll up, and push number tw twenty. Yeah
Project Manager: but like we said before, it has to be used on every television. Yeah So you may not be uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: No. The television must do that. So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm. Yeah, I think the younger people will have newer televisions, which can provide our uh remote control.
Project Manager: Yeah but young people have to have all their uh room. And mostly they are smaller. So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yes. But that won't be a problem. I think.
Project Manager: Most the times that are not advanced televisions.
Industrial Designer: No, but then we'll get to the regular uh remote controls.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: And I think, what I said, everybody has them uh has them already. And they go to a uh supermarket and buy them uh for two Euros. Uh, and ge and get the most cheapest uh thing. And I think we must look further to uh to devel d develop something news.
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: Uh, can you give an indication in b uh in the cost difference between uh the chip with L_C_D_ or without?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} I got it on my screen and it was uh higher. But I don't know uh how much higher. {vocalsound}
Marketing: 'Cause it {disfmarker}
Project Manager: That's important.
Marketing: I think if we have an L_C_D_, it will also sell a lot better.
Industrial Designer: That's true.
Marketing: And that might uh bring back the costs uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: But then we'll {disfmarker} I think we must discuss who {disfmarker} uh what will be better. If we have a better shape of the um remote control, or better options on it. With a scroll menu, a w scroll thing, and a L_C_D_. And then a flat um remote control. Or, a more hand-shaped remote control, with scroll, without L_C_D_.
Project Manager: Yeah. Maybe you can look how how much it is for the L_C_D_.
Industrial Designer: I can uh look on my uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} It's very important.
Industrial Designer: {gap} Uh {disfmarker} Note that the push-button requires a simple chip chip. A scroll wheel requires minimally a regular chip, which is a higher price range. The display requires a advanced chip, which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip.
Project Manager: Yeah, more expensive. But how much?
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Doesn't say. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Oh.
User Interface: Hmm.
Marketing: Huh.
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer: That's from my manufacturing division.
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: 'Kay. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Well, thank you.
Industrial Designer: Yes?
Marketing: My turn?
Project Manager: Next.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Mm. So {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} Yeah. So, my uh presentation is about trend-watching. Uh, I did some trend-watching. It's very important to uh keep up with latest trends. {vocalsound} 'Cause if you don't, you won't sell. So, well how we did do that? Uh, well we made an investigation of the market, by Trendwatchers. They uh watch in uh cities like uh Paris and Milan. Of course, well known for their uh trend {disfmarker} uh trends. And well, uh what did you find? Uh, we have two groups, young and trendy, and the old and rich. Well th and the young and trendy, they uh they starting to like uh fruit and vegetables uh as a theme for n uh clothes, shoes, and also uh products. And um, material? That should feel {disfmarker} have uh a spongy feeling. And to get a feeling for what it is, uh here is an image of it. Then the old and rich. They like uh dark colours, and simple, recognisable shapes.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: And um, they also like uh familiar material, uh especially wood. Now, another picture.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: To get a feeling for this. Well, uh then already come to my personal preferences. We uh aim at the younger market. So, we should also be uh look at their uh trends. However, with trends it's always if there's {disfmarker} it's now. It it it might last one year, and next year it be {disfmarker} uh can be totally different. And I think we want to sell our product for longer than one year. So, we m must not just only look at what the trend is now, as it might be totally different next year. So, that's uh one thing to keep in mind.
Industrial Designer: Changing covers. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah. Any questions?
Industrial Designer: Nope.
Project Manager: No. It's clear.
User Interface: No.
Project Manager: So now, it's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Ah, let's see. Now, w we have to decide {vocalsound} Well, we have to decide on the concept. So, we have to look at {disfmarker} 'S next. Components and user interface concept. So {disfmarker} Now, we have to make some concept. Maybe one of you can paint it on the board. First, uh user interface.
Industrial Designer: Uh, uh-uh. How w how we how we make it? Uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yes, a concept on uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Just {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Shouldn't we first discuss about like what w we all {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah, but maybe we can paint it. Uh, what do we want?
Industrial Designer: Yeah, but if I paint with {disfmarker}
Project Manager: I'll paint. Okay.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Well {disfmarker}
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: Something like this? Or {disfmarker} Shapes or {disfmarker} What do we need?
User Interface: Mm, yes. What?
Marketing: Can make several uh concepts.
Project Manager: Yes, okay.
Marketing: We have this, and we had the idea of an um a more uh uh uh like sh in the shape of your hand.
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer: More like something {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah I I I uh {disfmarker} yes. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: M like {disfmarker} Yeah I can't dr I can't draw it.
Project Manager: And you have to.
Industrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: I have to.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: I'm not a designer. It's more {gap} three D_. Like, um when you have a part here. This is the remote control. And then you have something like th this under it. So, it's easier to get it like this.
User Interface: Mm.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} {gap}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} It's like a gun. {vocalsound} Yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay.
User Interface: {voc
