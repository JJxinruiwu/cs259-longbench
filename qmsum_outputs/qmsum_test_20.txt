Grad F: Test.
Postdoc G: OK.
Professor B: Let's see, I should be Two.
PhD D: Up high {disfmarker}
Grad E: As close to your mouth as you can get it.
Professor B: La
PhD D: high as you can get.
Professor B: Is this channel one?
Postdoc G: Yeah, on your upper lip.
PhD H: Channel one one one.
Professor B: Gee, OK. Yes. OK.
Grad E: OK, so for {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} For people wearing the wireless mikes, like {disfmarker} like this one, I find the easiest way to wear it is sorta this {disfmarker} this sorta like that.
PhD H: This is {disfmarker} chan channel channel one one two three
Grad F: Channel five, channel five.
Professor B: Yeah. Mm - hmm. What do you do,
Grad E: It's actually a lot more comfortable then if you try to put it over your temples,
Grad F: Test, test test.
Professor B: you do it higher?
Grad E: so {disfmarker}
Professor B: Mm - hmm.
PhD D: Adam's just trying to generate good uh data for the recognizer there.
Postdoc G: Yeah, I think we're supposed to {disfmarker} that's right.
Grad E: And then also, for {disfmarker} for all of them, if your boom is adjustable, the boom should be towards the corner of your mouth,
Grad F: Test test.
PhD A: By the way, there was a bug. Yeah, i it wasn't using the proper
PhD D: Oh it was.
Grad E: and about a uh a thumb to a thumb and a half distance away from your mouth,
PhD A: basically it wasn't adapting anything.
PhD D: Oh.
Grad E: so about like I'm wearing it now.
PhD D: Oh that's interesting. So why didn't you get the same results and the unadapted?
Grad E: so so Jane, you could actually do even a little closer to your mouth,
PhD H: It's not always possible.
PhD A: Hmm?
PhD D: Why didn't you get the same results and the unadapted?
Postdoc G: I could {disfmarker} can this be adjuste like this?
Grad E: but {disfmarker}
PhD A: Oh, because when it estimates the transformer pro produces like a single matrix or something.
Grad E: Yep.
Postdoc G: Is that @ @? OK, thank you.
Grad F: Adam, I'm not {disfmarker}
PhD D: O Oh oh I see.
Grad F: uh, looks kinda low on channel five {disfmarker}
PhD D: I see, I see.
Professor B: OK.
Grad F: no?
Grad E: Channel five, s speak again.
Grad F: Maybe not.
Postdoc G: Hello.
PhD A: Basically there were no counts
Grad E: Yeah, that's alright.
Grad F: Hello?
Grad E: I mean, we could {disfmarker} we could up the gain slightly if you wanted to.
Grad F: It's OK?
PhD H: Yeah.
Grad F: Is this OK?
PhD H: OK.
PhD D: I see what you mean.
PhD C: Who's channel B?
Grad E: but {disfmarker} Uh, channel B is probably Liz.
PhD C: Uh oh.
PhD H: Uh channel B {disfmarker} I am channel B.
Professor B: You wanna close this,
Postdoc G: Channel eight, eight.
Professor B: or
PhD C: No I
Grad E: Thank you.
PhD H: No, channel B.
PhD A: Hello, hello.
PhD C: yeah, yeah, you're channel B.
PhD H: Yeah, yeah.
PhD C: So can you talk a bit? I thought it might be too
PhD H: OK, yeah, channel B, one two three four five.
PhD C: OK.
Grad E: Yeah, it's alright. So, the gain isn't real good.
Professor B: We're recording,
PhD C: OK.
Professor B: right?
Grad E: OK, so we are recording.
PhD H: Ah.
Professor B: Yeah.
PhD A: OK.
Grad E: Um everyone should have at least two forms possibly three in front of you depending on who you are.
Grad F: Oh.
Grad E: Um we {disfmarker} we're doing a new speaker form and you only have to spea fill out the speaker form once but everyone does need to do it. And so that's the name, sex, email, et cetera.
PhD H: Mm - hmm.
Grad E: We {disfmarker} we had a lot of discussion about the variety of English and so on so if you don't know what to put just leave it blank. Um I {disfmarker} I designed the form and I don't know what to put for my own region,
PhD A: Mmm.
Grad E: so
PhD D: California.
PhD A: I think {disfmarker}
Grad E: California.
PhD H: California.
PhD A: Um may I make one suggestion? Instead of age put date of {disfmarker} uh year of birth
Grad E: Sure.
PhD A: because age will change, but The year of birth changes, you know, stays the same, usually.
Grad E: Oh.
PhD C: A actually, wait a minute,
Grad E: Birth year?
Postdoc G: Although on {disfmarker}
PhD A: Yeah.
PhD C: shouldn't it be the other way around?
PhD D: Not for me.
Postdoc G: course on the other {disfmarker} on the other hand you could {disfmarker} you view it as the age at the time of the {disfmarker}
PhD C: On the other side,
PhD A: Well the thing is, if ten years from now you look at this form knowing that {disfmarker}
PhD C: yeah.
Postdoc G: Yes, but what we care about is the age at {disfmarker} at the recording date rather than the {disfmarker}
PhD C: O yeah.
PhD D: But there's no other date on the form.
PhD C: W we don't care how they {disfmarker} old they really are.
PhD A: Well {disfmarker} well I don't know.
Postdoc G: Yes. {vocalsound} Unless we wanna send them a card.
Grad E: Well I guess it depends on how long the corpus is gonna be collected for.
PhD A: Anyway.
Postdoc G: Yeah, that's true.
PhD C: I still don't see the problem.
Grad E: Either way yeah I think {disfmarker} I think age is alright
PhD A: OK.
Grad E: and then um there will be attached to this a point or two these forms uh so that you 'll be able to extract the date off that
PhD A: Mm - hmm.
Grad E: so, anyway. And so then you also have a digits form which needs to be filled out every time, the speaker form only once, the digit form every time even if you don't read the digits you have to fill out the digits form so that we know that you were at the meeting. OK? And then also if you haven't filled one out already you do have to fill out a consent form. And that should just be one person whose name I don't know. OK?
Grad F: Do you want this {pause} Adam?
Grad E: Uh sure. Thank you.
Professor B: So uh
Grad E: OK so should we do agenda items?
Professor B: Uh oh that's a good idea. I shouldn't run the meeting.
Grad E: Uh well I have {disfmarker} I wanna talk about new microphones and wireless stuff.
Postdoc G: Mmm.
Grad E: And I'm sure Liz and Andreas wanna talk about recognition results. Anything else?
PhD C: I guess {disfmarker} what time do we have to leave? Three thirty?
PhD A: Yeah.
PhD C: Yeah,
Grad E: Why don't you go first then.
PhD C: so.
Professor B: Yeah, good idea.
PhD A: OK.
PhD C: Um Well, I {disfmarker} I sent out an email s couple hours ago so um with Andreas'help um Andreas put together a sort of no frills recognizer which is uh gender - dependent but like no adaptation, no cross - word models, no trigrams {disfmarker} a bigram recognizer and that's trained on Switchboard which is telephone conversations. Um and thanks to Don's help wh who {disfmarker} Don took the first meeting that Jane had transcribed and um {vocalsound} you know separated {disfmarker} used the individual channels we segmented it in into the segments that Jane had used and uh Don sampled that so {disfmarker} so eight K um and then we ran up to I guess the first twenty minutes, up to synch time of one two zero zero so is that {disfmarker} that's twenty minutes or so? Um yeah because I guess there's some,
Grad E: Or so.
PhD C: and Don can talk to Jane about this, there's some bug in the actual synch time file that ah uh I'm {disfmarker} we're not sure where it came from but stuff after that was a little messier. Anyway so it's twenty minutes and I actually
Grad E: Hmm.
PhD C: um
Grad E: I {disfmarker} was that {disfmarker} did that {disfmarker} did that recording have the glitch in the middle?
Postdoc G: I'm puzzled by that. I {disfmarker} oh {disfmarker} oh, I see.
PhD C: There's {disfmarker} there's a {disfmarker}
Postdoc G: Oh there was a glitch somewhere.
PhD C: yeah, so that actually um
Grad F: Was it twenty minutes in,
PhD C: if it was twenty minutes in then I don't know
Postdoc G: I forgot about that.
Grad F: I thought {disfmarker}
PhD A: Well it was interesting,
Postdoc G: Well, I mean, they {disfmarker}
PhD A: suddenly {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the overall error rate when we first ran it was like eighty percent
Grad E: I don't remember when it is.
Postdoc G: but I was able to can transcribe
PhD A: but i looking at {disfmarker} the first sentences looked much better than that and then suddenly it turned very bad and then we noticed that the reference was always one off with the {disfmarker} it was actually recognized
PhD C: Wel
Grad E: Oh no.
Grad F: Yeah, that might be {disfmarker} that might be {disfmarker} that might be my fault.
Postdoc G: Wow.
PhD A: so
Grad E: Oh so that was just a parsing mismatch.
Grad F: I'm not {disfmarker}
PhD A: OK.
PhD C: No actually it was {disfmarker} yeah i it was a complicated bug because they were sometimes one off and then sometimes totally random so um
Grad F: yeah, I was pretty certain that it worked up until that time,
Postdoc G: Oh. That's not good.
PhD C: Yeah
PhD A: OK.
PhD C: so that's what we have
Grad E: Alright.
Grad F: so
PhD C: but that {disfmarker} that will be completely gone if this synch time problem
Postdoc G: Yeah.
Grad E: The {disfmarker} the glitch
PhD A: So {disfmarker} so we have everything recognized but we scored only the first uh whatever, up to that time to
Postdoc G: And the only glitch {disfmarker}
Grad E: yeah.
Postdoc G: yeah.
PhD C: So you guys know.
Professor B: S sorry I haven't seen the email,
PhD C: Yeah.
Grad E: Th - the
Postdoc G: The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} well {disfmarker} wait
Professor B: what was the score?
PhD C: So here's the actual copy of the email
Postdoc G: we should say something about the glitch. He {disfmarker} he can say something about the glitch.
PhD C: um oh OK
Grad E: yeah.
Postdoc G: Cuz it's {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker} h it's {disfmarker} it's very small {disfmarker}
PhD C: so does this glitch occur at other {disfmarker}
Grad E: There {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} there's an acoustic glitch that occurs where um the channels get slightly asynchronized
Postdoc G: very small. Yep.
PhD C: Oh.
PhD A: Mmm.
PhD C: Right.
Grad E: so the {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that problem has gone away in the original driver believe it or not when the SSH key gen ran the driver paused for a fraction of a second
Professor B: Hmm.
Grad F: Hmm.
Grad E: and so the channels get a little asynchronous and so if you listen to it in the middle there's a little part where it starts doing {disfmarker} doing click sounds.
Professor B: So {disfmarker}
PhD C: And is it only once that that happens?
Grad E: But yeah
PhD C: OK.
Grad E: it {disfmarker} right once in the middle.
PhD C: There's {disfmarker} the previous page has some more information about sort of what was wrong
Professor B: so {disfmarker} so un unsurprisingly Adam is the golden voice,
PhD C: but
Grad E: Um But that shouldn't affect anything
PhD C: OK so that's actually
Postdoc G: S and it {disfmarker}
Professor B: you see this here?
PhD C: It {disfmarker} y it's {disfmarker}
Grad E: yeah yeah " bah "
PhD C: OK no {disfmarker}
PhD A: Oh, and {disfmarker}
PhD C: What happens is it actually affects the script that Don {disfmarker}
PhD D: Huh.
PhD C: I mean if we know about it then I guess it could always be checked for it
Grad E: Well the acoustic one shouldn't do anything.
PhD C: but they
Grad F: Yeah, I don't know exactly what affected it
Postdoc G: I agree. I agree.
PhD A: I {disfmarker} I have {disfmarker}
Grad F: but I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll talk to you about it,
PhD A: Yeah.
Grad E: But I {disfmarker} I do remember {disfmarker}
PhD C: Yeah.
Grad F: I 'll show you the point.
Postdoc G: Yeah. It {disfmarker} it had no effect on my transcription,
PhD A: Mmm.
Postdoc G: you know, I mean I {disfmarker} I had no trouble hearing it and {disfmarker} and having time bins
Grad E: I do remember seeing once the transcriber produce an incorrect XML file where one of the synch numbers was incorrect.
Postdoc G: but there was a {disfmarker} Oh.
PhD C: Well, the {disfmarker} the synch time {disfmarker} the synch numbers have more significant digits than they should,
Grad F: That's what happened.
Postdoc G: Oh.
PhD H: Yeah.
Grad E: Where {disfmarker} where they weren't monotonic.
Grad F: There was {disfmarker} yeah, I mean {disfmarker}
PhD C: right? There's things that are l in smaller increments than a frame.
PhD H: Yeah.
Postdoc G: Oh, interesting.
PhD C: And so then, I mean you look at that and it's got you know more than three significant digits in a synch time then that can't be right
Grad E: Oh OK so that's
Grad F: Hmm.
Postdoc G: Oh.
PhD A: Mmm.
PhD C: so anyway it's {disfmarker} it's just {disfmarker}
Grad E: yeah sounds like a bug.
Postdoc G: Yeah.
PhD C: that's why we only have twenty minutes but there's a significant amount of {disfmarker}
Grad F: Non - zero? Um there are like more {disfmarker} cuz there's a lot of zeros I tacked on just because of the way the script ran,
Grad E: The other one I saw was that it yeah.
Grad F: I mean but there were there was a point.
PhD C: Yeah that was fine. That {disfmarker} that was OK.
Grad E: The other one I saw was non non - monotonic synch times
Grad F: OK.
Grad E: and that definitely indicra indicates a bug.
Grad F: Uh.
PhD C: Well that would really be a problem, yeah. So anyway these are just the ones that are the prebug for one meeting.
Grad F: Yeah.
PhD C: um and what's {disfmarker} which {disfmarker}
Grad E: So that's very encouraging.
PhD C: this is really encouraging cuz this is free recognition,
Professor B: Hmm.
PhD H: Yeah.
Professor B: Cool.
PhD A: Mmm.
PhD C: there's no I mean the language model for Switchboard is totally different so you can see some like this Trent Lott which
PhD D: Trent Lott.
PhD C: um I mean these are sort of funny ones,
PhD D: It 'll get those though.
PhD C: there's a lot of perfect ones and good ones and all the references, I mean you can read them and when we get more results you can look through and see
Grad E: I and as I said I would like to look at some of the other results to see what other {disfmarker} other bugs there are.
PhD C: So I will look at some of the other results.
Grad E: Yeah.
PhD C: I will send you a copy.
Grad E: Thanks.
PhD A: So I think I'll get some {disfmarker} the results and then we can go back and look at them again.
PhD C: And then we can compare the two.
Grad E: Yeah.
PhD C: And that will be a good {disfmarker} good idea.
Postdoc G: Yeah.
Grad E: So {disfmarker} the first meeting is off to a good start.
PhD C: I'm glad that it is. I'm glad that it is.
Grad E: Yeah.
PhD A: So {disfmarker} it's a good start.
PhD C: Yeah.
Grad E: So we can {
