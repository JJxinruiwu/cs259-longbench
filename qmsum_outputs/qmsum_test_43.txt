Project Manager: Okay. Uh door is closed. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Well, let's begin. Because if we have as much time as the last uh meeting, we'll have to hurry up.
Marketing: I'm listening.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Right.
Project Manager: Um well I'll start with the presentation again, the agenda.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Great.
Project Manager: Yo. So. {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} This one I think.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Uh yeah. Well alright. Um well, I'll show you the notes. It's not as uh interesting as it should be because we just uh had the meeting,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: but I'll show them. We'll get your presentations again on the conceptual design. Um {disfmarker} Then we'll have to dec decide about the control, the remote control concepts. I've put a f uh a file in the project management folder, which says exactly uh what kind of decisions we should take.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: So {vocalsound} this time we exactly know what to decide about.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Alright, great.
Project Manager: And then we'll close again.
Industrial Designer: Alright.
Project Manager: Uh {disfmarker} Well these are some examples, but we'll talk about them later. We'll {vocalsound} first look at your uh presentations. Alright?
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Walter will uh start again this time?
Marketing: Yeah, great.
Project Manager: Yo.
Marketing: Alright, Trendwatch.
Project Manager: 'Kay.
Marketing: {gap}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Right. I will speak about uh latest trends trends, latest fashion updates, and uh things we must not do.
Project Manager: 'Kay.
Marketing: Uh the trends. {vocalsound} It's very important that uh the control is fancy looking and good uh feeling. Uh this because of our last model was very functional, but {vocalsound} it uh people didn't like that, so our new mo model must be very good-looking. That's uh something you uh have to take a look at.
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm. Alright.
Marketing: And uh the feeling has to be very great. Also the menus and things like that they have to they have to feel great.
Industrial Designer: Alright.
Marketing: Um there's a minus uh two times here, because this is the most important point. This is uh two times as less important,
Project Manager: Less. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: and uh same for this one. {vocalsound} Um, technological technological innovations, that's uh regarded very highly too.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Uh such as an uh L_C_D_ screen, uh speech uh acknowledgement, as we uh talked about earlier.
Project Manager: Well, yeah.
Marketing: So we have to have uh something like that, like we uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: L_C_D_ and our uh our fronts.
Marketing: Right. {vocalsound} Uh the last point is easy to use. Well I think that uh speaks for s for itself. I don't know who's uh who's going to look at that.
Industrial Designer: Easy to use?
Project Manager: Well, easy to use uh s is a bit uh contradictionary with the first uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah?
Industrial Designer: I think that's your ta
User Interface: {gap}
Project Manager: Functional is not an issue, and then easy to use.
Marketing: Yeah, I know.
Project Manager: Well we have to choose one of them. {vocalsound}
Marketing: I think we have to go for the first one.
Project Manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Marketing: It's the most important one. So {gap} we have to uh take that one.
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: So it it {vocalsound} it isn't very important that {vocalsound} that it works easy.
User Interface: Well something fancy looking can be can be easy to use.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} But {vocalsound} it has to look great.
Project Manager: Yeah. We'll we'll look at uh {gap}.
Industrial Designer: You {disfmarker} Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
Marketing: We'll see. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: you can make a very complicated uh uh remote anyway, so ease of use {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It's not a very comp complicated device.
Marketing: Yeah, right. But the most important thing is that it looks great and people say {gap} wow, that's real great uh great concept.
Project Manager: 'Kay.
Industrial Designer: Alright.
Marketing: Alright. Uh these are the new colours of this year.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: So it must be very bright, very colourful.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing: People like this.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: So we we have to think uh in this direction.
Project Manager: So {disfmarker}
Marketing: So i set your mind to it.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Well {disfmarker}
Marketing: Findings? Fashion update? Fruit and vegetables are cool.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Uh you think?
Marketing: I am told. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: The group we are targeting is uh very pleased with fruit and vegetables.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: So {vocalsound} we we we might cons consider in front of uh in in that sort of uh way.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah, well {disfmarker}
User Interface: Bananas.
Marketing: Uh furthermore uh material, that's your part, should be very strong. I was thinking of something like uh {vocalsound} well uh iron plate over it,
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Marketing: maybe in a colour or something,
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: that looks so f really flashy but it it is also strong.
Industrial Designer: {gap}
Project Manager: B
Marketing: And that's uh also for the younger public.
Project Manager: Well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year. Th this year it's fruits but next year it's it's something totally different.
Marketing: Yeah, that's great.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: But I think we can all make the the fronts of titanium or something uh really thin.
Project Manager: Yes.
Marketing: So it looks very heavy but you can still uh use it very easily.
Project Manager: Yep, alright.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Marketing: Well, the don'ts. Older people like dark colours and simple shapes. Well we don't want uh older people,
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: we want young people.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {gap}
Marketing: So uh we're gonna turn that around.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Alright.
Marketing: We're gonna have real uh cool shapes and lots of colours. Right?
Project Manager: Wood is popular. Aha.
Marketing: Okay. We don't want wood.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah yeah yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, among the old people, yeah.
Marketing: Old people. So, that's it for me.
Project Manager: Alright. Nice, uh well {gap} show us.
Industrial Designer: Right, I am going to tell you something about the components design. Uh again I have uh put up the specification properties. This uh so um uh the different uh components of the of of the device. And the materials? Um I have heard several things, so I uh I'll have to change that on the way. But uh the case? Uh I suggested uh in the previous meeting hard plastic. But uh as you indicated uh it should be strong.
Marketing: Yeah, we should change that.
Industrial Designer: It should feel strong. So maybe plastic is not uh sufficient.
Project Manager: Well maybe it it it is,
Industrial Designer: We should move to uh something {disfmarker}
Project Manager: but it doesn't look strong. So maybe {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Well yeah. Y Hard plastic i is of course uh pretty pretty tough, but it doesn't have a really really tough look. So {disfmarker}
Marketing: No no no.
Project Manager: But we still have to look at our price of course. Because uh if we want an L_C_D_ uh window etcetera uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Also {disfmarker} Yeah. Mm-hmm. But we'll return to that.
Project Manager: Yeah?
Industrial Designer: Uh the buttons of course rubber, I think everyone agrees. And electrical cables, copper is all pretty basic stuff. The chips made of silicon, I guess. I think that's the best uh way to do it.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: And infra infrared l LED is uh just a simple bulb.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Then I've uh {vocalsound} had a few findings, made a few findings. Uh the target audience product style. Um it's uh um generally the case that uh senior and wealthy people above uh forty five years old uh like, as you said, uh particularly the traditional materials as such as wood and materials such as that. They also like straightforward shapes and luxurious style. But of course that's not our uh things this. So this is things we must not do.
Project Manager: Yes.
Industrial Designer: And then we have uh young uh and dynamic uh people, which is of course our uh group, the people we aim at. Um under forty five years old. Uh they like soft materials uh with primary colours. Soft materials is of course uh agai again a bit a contradiction with uh our uh material choice of what you said, that uh it should be hard an and and and and strong looking.
Marketing: Mm. Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: But they like soft materials, uh so we might uh we have to consider that. And also they like curved round shapes. So not uh too formal like like uh the older people want. And if uh also a finding but not very ap applicable here, that sports and gaming devices such as uh discmans for jogging and that those kind of devices, gaming devices, should define the characteristics of the device. But uh since we don't have a really a sports or gaming device, so we don't really have to consider that.
Project Manager: Sports uh, they're uh that uh are accessible on on your L_C_D_ uh window uh
User Interface: Soccer fronts. {vocalsound} Mm.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {disfmarker} Huh? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Project Manager: That's nice. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Hmm.
Project Manager: All the {gap} results?
Industrial Designer: Well I also have um several examples of uh styles,
Marketing: We keep coming back to the fronts. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: so you can get a clear picture of uh what I mean.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Uh {vocalsound} these are the basic uh older older peoples' stuff.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah.
Industrial Designer: It was not very uh interesting uh, very classical looking,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. {vocalsound} Nai. Uh no.
Industrial Designer: but that's n that's not what we want.
User Interface: Hmm.
Industrial Designer: We have these kind of things. I don't know what exactly they are.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Fruity. {vocalsound} Fruity.
Industrial Designer: It looks like {disfmarker} Well you know uh you recognise the shapes,
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: it's very primary colours, uh bright colours and uh round shapes.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: You also uh {vocalsound} see uh this device, it's not very round and {disfmarker} Fruity of course. Yeah, it uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: It's t terrible.
Industrial Designer: That's true.
Project Manager: Alright.
Industrial Designer: And uh well round shapes, primary colours.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: You can see it all here. And of course uh this famous device.
Project Manager: Hmm?
Industrial Designer: I think as you know something uh some devices like this.
Project Manager: Yeah, alright.
Industrial Designer: So to give you an idea of uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: Well it's got a strong look, this. Yeah.
Industrial Designer: This has a strong look. Although it's plastic, it's it's grey to to to give it iron look.
Marketing: Yeah, it still has a strong look.
Project Manager: Yeah. And it's round.
Industrial Designer: That's uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: But then you are losing your fruity colours.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Well we have to make a {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Well you can make th th th that middle ring can you you can make another colour. So uh those kind of things you can you can combine.
Marketing: That's true.
Industrial Designer: Well we can't really make a round uh a round remote control. I don't think that's very practical,
Project Manager: No, it isn't.
Industrial Designer: but {disfmarker} But uh it's important to to uh to think about the colour.
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Because if we make it grey or or silvery looking, it it does make it a lot more uh does make it looking a lot more stronger.
Project Manager: Yes.
Industrial Designer: 'Cause if you look at this, it it doesn't look very very strong,
Marketing: Yeah but the {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: becau But this is plastic, and and this too, but {disfmarker}
Marketing: But it doesn't have to look strong. The the results are, the feel of the material is expected to be strongy.
Industrial Designer: The feel? Uh alright.
Marketing: The feel.
Project Manager: So, if you ti
Industrial Designer: Well {disfmarker}
User Interface: And it it doesn't have to be strong, also.
Project Manager: Well {disfmarker}
Marketing: Nah yeah the feel {disfmarker}
Project Manager: You you {disfmarker} Maybe you should have uh some some coloured titanium or something.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Only the feel. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So it it looks pretty but it feels strong.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Right.
User Interface: Oh.
Industrial Designer: And I {disfmarker} Then I have some more findings. Um {vocalsound} uh about the energy energy source of the of the device,
Marketing: I agree.
Industrial Designer: uh I uh suggest uh the basic battery. I uh got some other um uh uh energy sources of course. But solar energy is not very practical inside a house, because you don't have a have a lot of uh sun.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: And uh kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical, I think, for uh for a simple remote,
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: that's a bit, oh, that's a bit uh {disfmarker} That's a bit uh much.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} {gap} No titanium. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: And I also suggest uh as a shape uh a double curved case.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Uh the disadvantage of that that you can use no titanium. That that's the information I received. If you use the curved case, uh a curved case, double curved then you can't use titanium.
Project Manager: What do you exactly mean with double curved?
Industrial Designer: Now uh this uh to give it a more modern look.
User Interface: {gap}
Industrial Designer: And uh {vocalsound} now the the shape, yeah, {gap} a curved case. Um yeah I think uh sort of triangle-shaped bottom or something. Uh {gap} a more modern look not plain, long box style, but {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound} I dunno.
Project Manager: Double curved?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} I'll draw it,
Project Manager: It it mean {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah. Yeah. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah, well okay. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: but maybe later.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} And it makes uh it gives it a more u user friendly shape, than if you have uh {gap}. Um anyway {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Um f as uh for the buttons, simple push buttons. No uh otherwi uh no um difficult scroll things or some uh things like that, because it makes more complex and expensive. And, uh as we agreed, we don't use a speaker or a sensor or um {vocalsound} uh speak uh speech uh controlled {vocalsound} device.
Marketing: Yeah right. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Because it makes it also more complex and expensive. But we do use an L_C_D_ screen, so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip, which is more complex and expensive. But {disfmarker} It's worth the trouble I think,
Project Manager: Well {disfmarker}
User Interface: The buttons can be made of an uh a soft material.
Industrial Designer: because {disfmarker}
User Interface: Because people like that.
Project Manager: This soft material thing? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} That's uh uh
