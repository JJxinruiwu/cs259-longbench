Marketing: {vocalsound} Okay. Oh I totally {disfmarker} Yeah 'cause I moved it. {vocalsound} 'S put it over here. Then we don't have to worry about it.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Ready for this?
Project Manager: All set? Cool. Alright, it is PowerPoint time. I've done more PowerPoints in this particular experiment than I've ever done in my life before this experiment {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah {vocalsound}.
Project Manager: which is kind of fun.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Oh man. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So uh here we have our detailed design meeting where we will um look at the prototype and um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} right so um, I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my {disfmarker} that my coach was sending to me. It means I'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting.
Industrial Designer: Oh really?
Project Manager: I think. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Marketing: Huh.
Project Manager: I don't know. Otherwise it's just saying I'm the secretary
Marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: and I'm {disfmarker} therefore I'm taking the minutes, s so just to go um {vocalsound} just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting, uh, I will open them slowly, no? Wait for it, wait for it. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah that's not you. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: No. That's how the {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Wait.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: This is, this is very high-powered stuff here, double-clicking, there we go. So um basically the moral of the story from our last minute uh {disfmarker} last meeting was that {vocalsound} um we that we had meetings from {disfmarker} uh we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer, uh or from Nathan, and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here um and what sort of limitations we're operating with um {disfmarker} uh excuse me what limitations we're operating under, what kind of risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition, I_E_ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape um because you didn't really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice. That would include some {disfmarker} mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users. Um, and uh the uh uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at. {vocalsound} So. That's sorted, back to the main {vocalsound} meet here, um, go ahead and take it away guys.
Industrial Designer: Well. Uh, we have assembled our prototype, um. What's to be said about it? Um, we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting, um. Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen which you can see
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions, um. This is going to be the on off button
Project Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: and we have these buttons to go through the channels um and then two volume buttons down here, d uh we decided those were the most important uh buttons. And then, for the more advanced uh functions there is a slide out panel here um and you can see that there are lots of other things going on. But this actually can slide back in and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away, um. As far as the uh whole visible light thing, we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out,
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Ah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Nice. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: why not?
Marketing: {vocalsound} Fair enough.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Of course, if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off. Um.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Perfect.
Industrial Designer: Go ahead.
User Interface: No it's important to {vocalsound} we talked a quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh faces and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: um f we call it fruity
Marketing: Right.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: if you will. Um. Right, um,
Marketing: Appropriate, okay.
User Interface: of course that's uh interchangeable
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: and uh I think it would be desirable for the uh for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued
Marketing: Mm 'kay.
User Interface: but this is kind of something that can be done
Marketing: It is an option.
User Interface: um and as you can see on the television there uh we have the uh voice detector device um on the top there.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Oh, right.
Industrial Designer: That's this here.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Ah. I see.
User Interface: Um. So that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this uh contraption. Um, what other things do we see here, well, um if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel,
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: um, so I think that will work well with regards to our market. Um and uh let's see, well clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available. {vocalsound} Um uh do you have anything else to add to that?
Industrial Designer: Um I worried about the materials, it is uh {disfmarker} the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating so it's very durable uh, it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped. Um, and of course as you can see and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel.
User Interface: It's actually important to note that the television, uh you know if there's an earthquake or anything like that, that i it actually is edible inside.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Fact, I dunno if you noticed, but I wrote the uh the company's name on the telephone screen,
Project Manager: Oh well done yeah, yeah oh ok
Industrial Designer: I thought that was kinda nice.
Marketing: Nice.
Industrial Designer: This was actually an apple on the inside.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: This {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Do we need to worry about um rot factors? {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Um {vocalsound} it's encased in a new uh type of uh
Marketing: Oh okay, there's preservatives involved,
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: polymer yeah.
Marketing: we don't need to worry,
Industrial Designer: We got a bit ahead of ourselves,
User Interface: It's fine.
Marketing: okay.
Industrial Designer: I know we're not talking about making televisions at this point or anything like that, but {disfmarker}
User Interface: Hmm.
Marketing: Fair enough.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Edible televisions, it's a wave of the future. {vocalsound}
Marketing: No but {disfmarker}
User Interface: It's pos a possible new product.
Marketing: {vocalsound} It's a couple years off at least. Okay.
User Interface: Um, but I think that's {disfmarker} I think that sums up the main features of our {disfmarker} of the remote,
Project Manager: Brilliant.
Industrial Designer: Right.
User Interface: um I dunno if you guys have any questions or f whether that uh {disfmarker} whether we need to worry about any uh other marketing areas or anything of that nature. Um, did we come in under budget?
Industrial Designer: Uh we did, yeah. This cost {disfmarker} well to put this into um production, we're looking at about {disfmarker} what was our goal? It was twelve fifty Euro um and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Um, so I was quite pleased with that.
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: One thing that we didn't do um {disfmarker} obviously we had a choice with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons, but we just went for a classic rubber button and um since we did that
Marketing: Mm.
Industrial Designer: we didn't have to use as many microchips which was quite nice and that's what helped keep the cost down.
Project Manager: Brilliant.
Industrial Designer: So even though it has a lot of modern technology, um for example the voice recognition,
Marketing: Mm.
Industrial Designer: in a lot of ways it's just a simple remote and um I think if we shopped around for other manufacturers um we might be able to get even cheaper.
Marketing: Okay.
User Interface: Mm. {vocalsound} Did we talk about the voice recognition uh option?
Industrial Designer: And {disfmarker} Oh no, we haven't talked about that yet have we?
User Interface: So uh so uh yeah on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition uh uh console
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Okay.
User Interface: and uh I think it's nicely designed into the into the overall look.
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: Um, but basically the voice recognition uh incorporates um the latest designs that our research team has been able to cufw uh come up with. Basically uh quite similar to the coffee maker um design that we were talking about earlier
Marketing: Mm 'kay.
User Interface: and um, I think that uh has given a proven um {vocalsound} ease of use and what not.
Industrial Designer: Hmm. Yeah.
User Interface: And uh allows features like the remote actually talking back to the user um, so.
Marketing: Right.
Project Manager: Cool.
Industrial Designer: Any questions?
Project Manager: No, no
Marketing: {vocalsound} Do we have um other, for lack of a better word, skins? Covers?
Project Manager: I think that's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: In play now or are those ones gonna be developed later once we see how the couple we have g go or?
Industrial Designer: Um, do you wanna answer this one
Marketing: Do we know where we stand on that yet?
Industrial Designer: or do you want me to answer it?
User Interface: Well we didn't quite have enough material uh {vocalsound}.
Marketing: Oh I wasn't expecting a prototype
Industrial Designer: Yeah, yeah.
User Interface: Oh I see,
Marketing: I just didn't know {disfmarker} if you guys had any in mind yet. {vocalsound}
User Interface: right, um.
Industrial Designer: Um, well {vocalsound} as you can see this is just a most superficial layer and um it'd be very easy to put another layer of something else like {disfmarker}
Marketing: Okay. Just veneer really,
User Interface: Right.
Marketing: yeah. Okay.
User Interface: Actually this bottom red ring here just unclips
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: and then you put a a new a new uh a new plate on top of that.
Marketing: And the whole thing {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Okay
User Interface: So I mean there are {disfmarker} I {disfmarker}
Marketing: Right
User Interface: we definitely priced out a spongy {disfmarker} even spongier non-natural look um materials
Marketing: Yeah. There's {disfmarker} Okay.
User Interface: which I think worked out fine. We also continued on with the ideas that f following uh Apple's colour schemes with the kind of the uh light orange and the green.
Marketing: Mm 'kay. Okay, very cool.
Industrial Designer: It's not it's not quite a a face plate, it's more like a pseudo-face plate because it's simple enough
Marketing: Okay.
Industrial Designer: that in the factory it could {disfmarker} we could very easily put a different one on it, it locks into place such that, you know, it's pretty permanent but at the same time, if we wanna go the other way it's just a matter of a couple of adjustments and we could go the face plate way
Marketing: Okay.
Industrial Designer: if you know what I mean.
Marketing: Yep. It's still an option if we need it.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Very cool, nice job.
Project Manager: Right, yeah thanks guys that's very, very good work. I like it, brilliant. {vocalsound} Um, {vocalsound} what we need to discuss now is the finance of it, um I got me {disfmarker} you've got {disfmarker} you provided a number that actually sounds quite nice. Um the trouble is I was just given this by finance. Um, it's a spreadsheet of the parts {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Oh.
Project Manager: and I've just tentatively put in what it's going to look like um.
Industrial Designer: Ooh.
Project Manager: I'm just gonna clear this out real quickly, but it looks like {disfmarker} So we'll just {disfmarker} if we can just itemize what's in here, we've got this {disfmarker} it's a solar cell thing right?
Industrial Designer: Right
Project Manager: With a back-up battery?
Industrial Designer: uh we didn't really touch on that but it it's in there,
Project Manager: With the ba okay. Um
Industrial Designer: yep.
Project Manager: and {disfmarker}
User Interface: The voice recognition area actually doubles as uh as the solar cell area. Yeah.
Project Manager: Clever, clever, well done. Um so I guess that would mean we've got a bit of a um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It's a s a speaker and a sensor at the same time isn't it?
Industrial Designer: Yeah, yeah. It's just making use of the same space and the same materials,
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Okay. Um and the case, it's more of a single-curved case, I guess would be that {disfmarker} be the general {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah, one big curve I guess you could say.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Um and we've got a rubber skin material basically throughout. Um. Push button interface um with this other drop-down so maybe we've got two push button interfaces don't we?
Industrial Designer: Yeah, mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Um. And um a special {disfmarker} I guess it's uh {disfmarker} we've got a sort of a wood materi a rubbery type material that {disfmarker} throughout,
Industrial Designer: Yeah, special.
Project Manager: yeah.
Industrial Designer: And s I guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well, don't you? 'Cause it i it is very unconventional,
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah, it's it's quite unique.
Industrial Designer: I like to think of it as unconventional.
Project Manager: I like it, yeah it's {disfmarker} So it looks like
Marketing: M come in at sixteen?
Project Manager: a bit over budget, um.
Industrial Designer: Oh. Huh, doesn't match up does it?
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So what we could do perhaps, a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells {vocalsound} um or take out the back-up battery. Uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: How do you feel about that?
User Interface: I mean I think that uh if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features, being environmental and without the batteries and what not, although it does still have a battery so I'm not sure that {disfmarker} you know what the sell is on that.
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: I mean we could take we could take the battery out of it you see and it'd probably work ninety nine per cent of the time but you're gonna have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time when people are calling and saying oh look my remote isn't working
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: what am I gonna do?
Marketing: Mm k.
Industrial Designer: People'd be real upset. I think in the long-run it's better to keep the battery,
Marketing: True.
Industrial Designer: it's hard to scrap the whole cell battery idea 'cause that's so integral to the theme that we have.
Project Manager: Hmm. {vocalsound} What's difficult, we have all these things integral to the um to the design of it that we just can't back out of now,
Marketing: Nah.
Project Manager: it would have to be {disfmarker} seems like we'd have to go back to square one in a way. Um if we were gonna try to undo one bit we'd probably have to undo most of it, um {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Although we don't wanna get rid of the whole environmental {disfmarker} I mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we're marketing this as like a natural, new thing, but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget if I'm doing my math right.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Brilliant.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} So what's the final product looking like? {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Let me {vocalsound} tell you. {vocalsound} We're looking at a product that is {disfmarker} actually quite unique, it's got a solar cell, a speaker and a sensor, and the case is a single-curved {disfmarker} material with a rubbery type material that's throughout, with a drop-down interface and a push button interface. {vocalsound} And the best part is it's all {disfmarker} eco-friendly, with a battery that's powered by a small solar cell on the back.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {v
