User Interface: I think it is.
Project Manager: Oh nei. Uh no. {vocalsound} Alright. This is copy paste. So {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: From me of course, yeah.
Project Manager: Of course. You had some very strange layout.

User Interface: No you go and I'll uh supplement you.
Industrial Designer: Alright. If I make mistakes uh you'll uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah.
Project Manager: Correct. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Right. Uh well this is our design.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Uh it's pretty uh much uh like uh Mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting. With uh the different uh perspectives of it. Uh we'll begin uh with the front. We have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape. Um with uh the upper part being the front. Th So there's this part um {vocalsound} which is made of hard plastic, the front. And uh we're we're using different colours. Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours,
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah.
Industrial Designer: and later we'll put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: But basically, different colours, bright colours not black, too dark. Fancy colours. {vocalsound} Um then we have uh the lower part {vocalsound} of the of the device. Uh which is of course um part of the back actually, because it's also titanium. You can see it also on the on the on the side view, that only this part is the front, and the rest of it, the under uh the under side uh of it, yeah, the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium, and has the titanium colour of course, the look. Um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner,
Project Manager: Mm.
Industrial Designer: uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back, part of the titanium uh titanium part.
User Interface: Yeah, it's a double R_, but {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah?
User Interface: It's a double R_.
Industrial Designer: It's a double R_. Yeah the logo {disfmarker}
User Interface: But {vocalsound} it's very difficult to to draw that in {disfmarker} Yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah, alright.
Industrial Designer: Uh uh it's difficult to draw so small, but it's our double R_ uh logo is in there.
Project Manager: Okay. Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Um so that's the logo in the upper lef uh right corner. Then we have the buttons. Uh it's difficult to draw again the little oval or round {disfmarker} I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons.
User Interface: Oval yeah.
Project Manager: Alright.
Industrial Designer: So {gap} uh oval, n those are here. And then we have the m The m
User Interface: Channel up and volume?
Industrial Designer: Yeah the the con the the the, yeah, the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here. Um um with kind of arrow shapes, which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or um uh {vocalsound} uh square buttons. And also here are the two uh buttons we agreed on. We have the Okay button. Oh nei we uh the Okay button's here in the middle of the of the operators, of the channel and uh volume um changers.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: And then we've here the Menu button and the {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Alright.
User Interface: Menu for the L_C_D_ screen.
Industrial Designer: And the video button. The {disfmarker}
Project Manager: So {disfmarker}
Marketing: Mm right.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah. And of course this low part, this is the L_C_D_ screen.
Project Manager: 'Kay.
Industrial Designer: Uh this is what we made of it. You can make uh suggestions uh if you want.
Project Manager: Well if I look at it, the side the side view {disfmarker}
User Interface: Well, at the back {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Maybe we maybe we should finish first uh our talk
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: and then you can add suggestions.
Project Manager: Oh yeah alright. Yeah {gap}.
Industrial Designer: Maybe I I don't want to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I don't want to suppress you but n I'll uh finish this uh quick.
Project Manager: {gap}
Industrial Designer: Um okay I've had everything I guess on the front?
User Interface: No the back. With the logo and our uh l uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah the back. Yeah. {vocalsound} We thought about {disfmarker} Yeah, uh the back is of course totally titanium. {vocalsound} And we thought about the logo big in the middle.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Just so again the double R_. We have then the logo on front and on the back.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Maybe that's too much
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer: but you have to say uh say that if you think that way.
User Interface: No I don't think {disfmarker} And the {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: And the company slogan, we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: That's basically what we were thinking about,
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay.
Industrial Designer: and {disfmarker}
Project Manager: W
User Interface: And about the side view um {disfmarker} This the front won't be as thick,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: but again th the the drawing technique makes it very difficult to to really uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Well I see, but {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Oh and uh before I forget. Yeah the the voice, of course,
Project Manager: Well. Yeah I see it.
Industrial Designer: the voice recorder is uh at the bottom.
Project Manager: Yes.
Industrial Designer: And you can record it uh using, yeah, the the the back of the f w device.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: When I look at uh when I look at this side view, I think w when I have that in my hand, it's terrible.
User Interface: Well, it won't be visible. Mm?
Project Manager: If if you look if if this this is thick, and this is thin, th th then it that it lies over your hands. But {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Why? {vocalsound} Well it fits uh it it it it fits the hand, {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: mean uh the the the the {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Well what what what I what I agree is that when uh when um you have such of uh an arc in the middle, so that the the a the ends and the fronts is a bit thicker, so th then it falls over your hands.
Marketing: Yeah, I agree.
User Interface: {gap} If y {vocalsound} If you handle a remote, you you usually don't have your hand straight like this.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} In the middle in the {disfmarker}
User Interface: You you have it a bit uh {disfmarker} Yeah.
Marketing: It depends on the size. If it's kinda small, this is is great. But if it's it's larger, then you want to grab it.
Project Manager: And how large is it?
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah, that's the question.
Industrial Designer: That's the question.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Uh well {disfmarker} Yeah. H What do you suggest I mean we do? {gap} This was Mike's prototype,
Project Manager: Well uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: and y you seemed to agreed on it.
Project Manager: Well the sides I haven't seen yet, uh {gap}?
Industrial Designer: But now you have a totally different {gap}.
User Interface: Well, they lay there all the time.
Industrial Designer: The size? Yeah well the size doesn't really matter w I mean {disfmarker}
Project Manager: They the the the the the side view,
Industrial Designer: Side? Uh oh the side?
Project Manager: we didn't uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: W we we he drew the s the side,
User Interface: Yeah yeah.
Industrial Designer: but you d you weren't paying attention as usual.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Well any case, we'll discuss it now. Uh I think uh this is a pretty good uh good idea {gap}.
Marketing: Yeah, I agree with the L_C_D_ screen. You have it in your palm like this, and you can watch uh watch the screen. And if you have it li in the middle, your hand might be over it.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: But you you hold it like this.
User Interface: Yeah you you don't you don't grab it,
Industrial Designer: You're not holding it like this or something.
User Interface: you you {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: You, yeah, y How do you call it? Yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Well y y y you don't have it like this.
Project Manager: No no no.
Industrial Designer: You have it more like this.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {gap} You you you're using buttons this way, or if you're right-handed, this way.
Marketing: Like you're holding your telephone.
Project Manager: Yep.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: So you {disfmarker} Yeah. So {disfmarker}
Marketing: Because if you have a screen on it, you wanna look at your screen.
User Interface: Hmm. That way, it it falls into your hand. I think. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yeah well {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer: And maybe you can you can grab it a bit higher,
Marketing: Yeah, I agree on this.
Industrial Designer: so {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: No, I don't think so. That's not uh the point {disfmarker}
User Interface: No but but {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Well the the {disfmarker} Well that's a reason to to to put the L_C_D_ screen uh of course on the upper side, but {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Well f for as far as I can see, three of us agree
Project Manager: Yeah well
User Interface: and only Nils {disfmarker}
Project Manager: uh I think uh if you t if you three uh agree then then that's it.
User Interface: But you're the Project Manager, you can make the hard decisions. {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yes. So uh I c I c
Industrial Designer: If necessary.
Project Manager: Well, we'll we we'll do it like this.
Industrial Designer: But uh are d Can you live with it? Uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Alright, if you think that that's the way it should {gap} {disfmarker}
User Interface: Yeah?
Industrial Designer: Y Yeah, y y y y you said it was totally uh unusable.
Project Manager: No {disfmarker} No,
Industrial Designer: But do you
Project Manager: when I I my personal taste is that I want it to fall over my hands with a thick {disfmarker} But {disfmarker} In the market uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: But d you don't think this is completely unusable I guess. I think.
Project Manager: No not totally.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Not totally, well {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} For me, I I wouldn't buy it. Let's say it like that.
Industrial Designer: Yeah but of course y you are also human. We have to take uh {vocalsound} every everyone into account. So {disfmarker}
Project Manager: No {gap} {disfmarker}
Marketing: And you might be uh {disfmarker} You might be target customer.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Yes but {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Well uh who who else thinks like you?
User Interface: Mm.
Industrial Designer: We don't know.
Project Manager: Yeah, we don't know,
Industrial Designer: Maybe a thousand people,
Project Manager: but that's uh that's that's that's more market research.
Industrial Designer: or a million people.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So {vocalsound} let it be like this at uh at this moment.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Let it be.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay?
Industrial Designer: Alright. So that's that.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Uh any other suggestions?
Project Manager: No, I think it's great.
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: But what about the redesigning?
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Comes to that later.
User Interface: Okay. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Um you. Uh c You can uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Walter. {vocalsound} You can do the evaluation uh criteria on this?
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} You're very personal again.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Alright. Great.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: That's more useful than just {vocalsound} speaking.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Well, this is just a short intro.
Project Manager: Yes.
Marketing: I'm going to do uh the ev evaluation. That's gonna be done at the end of seven point skill criteria.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: So I made a {disfmarker} I made a few questions on the hand of uh uh the impor most important requirements and trends.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: And we have to look if our uh if our device uh is working correctly. Well, I put some questions in a Word file. See if I can find them. Uh uh uh uh mm.
Project Manager: 'Kay.
Marketing: Well {disfmarker}
User Interface: Hmm.
Marketing: I uh think you have all seen uh this kind of evaluation, so uh I don't have to explain it. Uh the first question is, uh is the device good-looking? Because normal p uh most people thought that um earlier devices were ugly ugly. Seventy five percent of them. So what do we think?
Industrial Designer: Well d we designed it, so of course we are very {disfmarker}
User Interface: Mm.
Project Manager: Yeah, we're we're not quite uh objective about this.
Marketing: Yeah {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
User Interface: Well we designed it to be good-looking.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: No, I know, but {vocalsound} that's why we made it look like this.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: And what about the functionality? What's the most important thing to you?
User Interface: Mm.
Marketing: Well, I think the most important thing is the user experience. Because normal people thought that um earlier devices were ugly ugly. Seventy five percent of them. So what do we think?
Industrial Designer: We designed it to be user-friendly. So of course we are very {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yeah, we're not quite objective about this.
Marketing: Yeah {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
User Interface: Well we designed it to be easy to use.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: No, I know, but {vocalsound} that's why we made it look like this.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: And what about the performance? What's the most important thing to you?
User Interface:
