Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} I'm proud of it. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay. This is our final meeting, the detailed design meeting. And again I'll take minutes. The {disfmarker} what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two, so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: It does look very cool.
Project Manager: Um then
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Then I need to say some st a few things about finance, 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria. Um and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits. Um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through. So we've got forty minutes. S
Marketing: And then do we get to make a remote control?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} 'Cause we missed out.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah.
Project Manager: So
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: it's now {disfmarker} I guess that we're supposed to start at fifteen thirty five, so we've got until four fifteen.
Industrial Designer: Uh-huh. How how much do we have, forty minutes?
Project Manager: Is that right?
User Interface: Yeah, about four fifteen, yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah,
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: until about four fifteen. So yeah. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay, so.
Project Manager: Go for it. Do you want {disfmarker}
User Interface: So, you said um {disfmarker} are are we starting with the the {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Yes.
Industrial Designer: Presentation.
User Interface: so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things and and then I will explain the the user interface th uh things, like the buttons and the scrolling things and {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay. {vocalsound} Okay. So um basically going with our trend of vegetables and {vocalsound} {disfmarker} we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} You think bananas are a safe thing to use?
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing: It's a bit um phallic.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Um {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} Well, but it's it's just an a approximation. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Dual use, perfect.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Dual use, perfect.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Oh, {vocalsound} {gap} your remote control? Oh that's just bad. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Does it vibrate when you press the buttons?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again.
Project Manager: Sorry, sorry.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: So now we we have the {disfmarker} okay,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: so Ma Maarika will explain you the user interface there. And it flips open on the side, so it opens like that. And we have the user interface o in here
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Wow.
Industrial Designer: and uh {vocalsound} the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside. Um well, everything else is probably user interface, so. Yeah, yeah.
Project Manager: And it's {disfmarker} the whole thing's made of rubber, is that {disfmarker}
User Interface: Uh yeah.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh yeah. Yeah, it has, yeah.
User Interface: Rubber.
Marketing: Is it to scale, or do you think you can make it a bit smaller?
User Interface: Yeah, {gap}. Um it could be made a bit smaller, and and of course it would be {gap} and {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: {vocalsound} yeah, but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing, that one side was supposed to be rounder,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah,
User Interface: so we said the back side round, yeah.
Industrial Designer: well, but i since it's made of rubber anyway. I I think it's it's uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: It l does look like the {gap} curvy
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: and then the whole shape's curvy, so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Mm. Hmm.
User Interface: Yeah. And it's spongy as well. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} I wasn't very keen on that, but yeah. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: So {vocalsound} so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the {vocalsound} on the cover we just have the very basic things.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Huh. Mm-hmm.
User Interface: So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three {disfmarker} there would be numbers in in the {disfmarker} on the actual one.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: So it's four, up to four, up to seven, up to nine and zero, z zero here.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Six seven eight nine. I like that.
User Interface: Yeah. And then, well this is on off button. It's it's quite standard mm place for it and and also the colour is quite often red, so it's it's kind of user friendly.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and {disfmarker} like the previous one and the next one.
Project Manager: Uh-huh.
User Interface: And and we would also have a l little um thing saying here, previous and ne prevon prevon next.
Marketing: So where's the volume?
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: The volume is is scrolling.
Industrial Designer: It's on the side.
User Interface: On the side,
Marketing: Ah, you did get that in then,
User Interface: this one. Yeah you just do it like this.
Marketing: mm-hmm.
User Interface: And and and it's it's on the back is mm cover or back lid, because if you flip it open, you can still do the scrolling here.
Marketing: Oh okay, {gap}.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: See? So the volume is {vocalsound} you just scroll, but then once you flip it open, {vocalsound} okay, there there you have the screen
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: and and you have the mm {vocalsound} spinning wheel with options to choose.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: You can move back and forth and then if you need to m choose something on the screen, you just push the cen mm the middle button.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Cool. Oh, the thing we forgot was like a mute button.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Uh no, we we'd not put {gap} {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
User Interface: A mute button.
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: so on on the cover we have the the bare essentials.
User Interface: Well, {gap} we'll have this on the screen, on the display.
Project Manager: Y or you could have it {disfmarker} so you {disfmarker} on the wheel if you {disfmarker}
Marketing: On the wheel, like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute.
Industrial Designer: Uh on the L_C_D_ we r you know, the main menu will have various options.
User Interface: Well, but the but the mute {disfmarker} yeah, the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute, right?
Project Manager: But if you hold it in,
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Marketing: Yeah, but it's a scroll and click, isn't it?
Project Manager: if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in?
Marketing: Okay, cool.
User Interface: Okay, yeah, okay.
Marketing: So that {gap} that solves the whole mute issue.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
User Interface: Yeah. {vocalsound} And okay, so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it.
Project Manager: {gap} no.
User Interface: You can't really see it in the interface.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah, it's hidden in there somewhere.
User Interface: Yeah. And we do have the logo on it as well.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm, very good.
User Interface: So I think it {disfmarker}
Project Manager: And it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: {gap}.
Industrial Designer: Cool.
User Interface: Yeah, I think um we could do l the logo in grey, as it is on the website.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} We ran out of resources here, so. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Yeah.
User Interface: In the actual one.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: You can have a look. {vocalsound}
User Interface: So if you have questions.
Project Manager: Very good, let's have a look.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Test it out. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {gap}. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Uh it's a sort of intermediate colour, I guess.
Marketing: Yeah, oh, we hold the remote.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Oh, but it it does feel all cold and slimy.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: I hate Play-Do, it's just minging.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: But yeah, uh that's cool, cool.
Project Manager: Very good.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Okay, so maybe if we go on to evaluation cri criteria
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: and then we'll there {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah, see the budget.
Project Manager: I suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues, but um we'll se I'm sure we can get around them somehow.
Marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: We'll just send all of our manufacturing to some nice poor country
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: and cut some of the prices that way.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Wales. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Wales, for example. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm. Cool, okay. Right, okay. {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Fabulous,
Project Manager: Marketing Expert.
Marketing: yeah. Okay, cool. So what we're gonna do is prefer {disfmarker} prepare the evaluation of the new design. {vocalsound} Um so we're gonna be using a seven point scale,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: so one is, you know, yes, it totally meets with that requirement and seven is, no, it really doesn't, we need to go back and start again. Um, you know. Basically, what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them. Um you know, so that we can evaluate each one and like {disfmarker} so it was about going back to the start and saying oh yeah, we did manage to do that, or oh no, we really forgot about that.
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: Okay?
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Cool, so these are what they are. Oh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: So for each of these we need to give it a one to seven. Is that right?
Marketing: Yes, I did have A_, B_, C_, and D_ down here, but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points.
Project Manager: Mm dots, never mind.
Marketing: Okay. But if you can imagine that they say A_, B_, C_, and D_, then that would be really good.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I guess we'll give it maximum points in everything. {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah, the yeah, it's definitely attractive. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah, I agree.
User Interface: Oh, the locatable thing we actually forgot.
Marketing: Well, I thought we'd um kinda said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the T_V_?
Project Manager: Yeah, just prepare one now.
User Interface: Yeah. Shall I just prepare it now?
Marketing: {vocalsound} Yeah.
User Interface: It will be red, too.
Marketing: Cool. Okay. So, be attractive to look at. That's this one. What do you all say?
Industrial Designer: So?
Project Manager: I reckon it {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound} S seven was th the maximum, yeah?
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: I I go for seven.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yes.
Marketing: Oh {vocalsound} we're all so proud of the {gap}.
Project Manager: Seven, yeah, it's terribly sexy. Yeah.
Marketing: Okay, so that'll be a seven for A_.
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Could {disfmarker} oh no, you can't whilst that's up there. Okay um uh what I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in.
Project Manager: Ah, okay.
Industrial Designer: Okay.
Project Manager: Excellent. Except we can't {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: But we can we can {disfmarker}
Marketing: But that's alright.
Project Manager: uh we can if we {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: I can I can take note uh uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: If you take a note of them, and then I'll put them in in a minute.
Project Manager: then yeah, I'll take a note, it's fine.
Marketing: Okay, so {vocalsound} we're all agreeing on seven for A_?
Project Manager: Yeah.
Marketing: Cool, okay. Does it match the operating behaviour of the user?
Industrial Designer: Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people,
Project Manager: I think it does.
User Interface: I would think yes, yeah.
Marketing: Yeah. I mean {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: so if you're left-handed you're kind of left uh scrolling with your finger.
User Interface: Yeah,
Project Manager: Alright.
User Interface: so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m {vocalsound} model another another version, which is like exactly the mirror image of this one.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: But that's gonna be a problem,
Industrial Designer: But then {disfmarker} yeah.
Project Manager: 'cause you don't always have all left-handers or all right-handers in a family.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: So bu it's it's not a huge problem,
Marketing: I th I think it's not {vocalsound} it's not like it's a pen.
Industrial Designer: because i i it is operatable.
User Interface: But then then I think left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway,
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: so they just {disfmarker}
Marketing: Yeah, but I mean because it's not like it's a pen, you know, left-handed people can't normally write right-handed,
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: but they can normally do most things right-handed,
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Right.
Marketing: so I would say it's not such a big issue.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: Yeah, because I mean anyway, right-handed people would be able to scroll with it,
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: I mean you can you can use your finger to to scroll rather than your thumb.
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: so i if the majority are right-handed, it's uh {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yep.
Marketing: So I mean that does kind of negate the whole R_S_I_ issue.
Project Manager: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Marketing: So maybe we need to put {disfmarker} that needs a little bit of investigation, maybe give it a five, I would say?
Project Manager: Um {disfmarker}
Marketing: What do you what do you all think?
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Project Manager: Six.
User Interface: Or maybe six, because it's just one one i one among the issues,
Project Manager: Yeah, I think six is a good option.
User Interface: And then it will be the maximum.
Marketing: Okay.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} So yeah, we'll put {disfmarker} six.
Marketing: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah, we'll put it {disfmarker} six.
User Interface: And so it's all set then.
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: So, yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound} it's all set.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: So, yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound} it's all set.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: So, yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound} it's all set.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: So, yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound} it's all set
