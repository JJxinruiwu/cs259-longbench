Project Manager: So
Marketing: So {disfmarker}
Project Manager: I hope you're ready for this uh functional design meeting.
Marketing: Of course. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Um so I will take the minutes you mm you three are going to do presentation. Um uh we want to know {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} at the end to know the new project's requirement so we need uh to know the the user uh needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the {disfmarker} from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and um third part {vocalsound} uh I don't remember {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: which is not very good. Ah of course, how to to design this uh this {disfmarker}
Marketing: Nice stuff {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} yeah. So um let's go for the three presentations, so first um Marketing Expert.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Who starts? {vocalsound} Oh. Ha. okay.
Project Manager: So wait a minute. Mm.
Marketing: So I dunno if I can do that like this? Yeah? So it's being modified. Do you want {disfmarker} yeah, open. Read only. I hope I saved it. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: So, um
User Interface: Sammy Benjo. I know this name uh.
Marketing: yeah, this is my name. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Sounds uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound} We met before.
Marketing: So as you know, you {disfmarker} I think you already know me, Sammy Benjo. I am the expert in marketing and I want to tell you about what people uh s want and uh like and dislike in remote controls, and I hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly. So next please. Uh-oh. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Mm {vocalsound} uh.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, it is put F_ five {gap}.
Project Manager: Hmm.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Hmm.
Industrial Designer: The full page presentation, yep.
Marketing: Yeah maybe in the full page
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: F_ F_ five.
Marketing: because i I spent lots of time doing this presentation, so.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Yep.
Project Manager: F_ five.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Uh-huh hmm okay.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Mm.
Marketing: So basically uh what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control, let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about w the current remote controls, what they like, what they don't like and um and what they do with them by the way {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: because they are supposed to be useful. {vocalsound} Don't forget about that. So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls and I'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey. And next please. Yeah, so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls. First of all, they find it very ugly. {vocalsound} Current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one uh they're not nice colour, not nice shape, I mean they're all the same, and they're not l good looking. Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were {disfmarker} people are ready to pay for nice and look {disfmarker} and fancy looking uh remote control, so I think we should probably spend lots of time in {disfmarker} and effort in that um. And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it {disfmarker} the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls. For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another. And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used, so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using. Um next please. {vocalsound} Now {vocalsound} people are very frustrated w with their {vocalsound} remote controls
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing: and they for instance uh they don't even find it {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: it's {vocalsound} it's often lost somewhere in the in the {disfmarker} in your home and nobody knows where it is.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: Agree.
Marketing: Maybe if we have something where we could {vocalsound} ask the remote control please, where are you?
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound} Like uh something to to {disfmarker} like t I think phones. Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality. Uh of course phone you can always phone your phone
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: but {vocalsound} you can't phone your {vocalsound} your remote control.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} You can {disfmarker} you are {gap}.
Project Manager: Why not? {vocalsound}
Marketing: But why not? Yeah.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use,
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
Marketing: in fact they don't even know how to use them, so most of the the people say they they don't know how to {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} to use properly their r remote controls. And uh they are bad for R_S_I_ but uh I don't remember what is R_S_I_.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay uh tha that's look great.
Marketing: {vocalsound} So I think they are bad. {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} R_S_I_ mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing: Mm-hmm. Mm nobody has any idea about that? Well I'll check uh with my
Industrial Designer: Yeah, it's electromagnetic waves or something kind of maybe uh effect.
Marketing: Oh, okay,
User Interface: No, I don't think so.
Marketing: I think it's a technical thing
Industrial Designer: Yeah,
Marketing: which our {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: because infrared uses some electromagnetic technology,
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. Okay.
Marketing: Okay.
User Interface: Okay.
Industrial Designer: and those waves have high {disfmarker}
Marketing: So, it seems that {vocalsound} it's a lot of people for a concept that we don't know {vocalsound}
User Interface: But twenty six percent, do you know {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Or something we don't know. {vocalsound} Mm-hmm. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Uh.
User Interface: Twenty five. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Uh.
Marketing: but we have to take this into account.
User Interface: Every fourth, you know. {vocalsound} Every four {disfmarker} some of us knows.
Industrial Designer: Yeah it's {disfmarker} People really {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay.
Marketing: So anyway
User Interface: One of us {disfmarker}
Marketing: that's for what the biggest frustration uh of the user and um
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Yeah.
Marketing: what else do I have? Next slide? Ah yeah.
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: So we've listed a couple of uh
User Interface: Functions.
Marketing: s uh functions that may be uh used by u the user in the current uh available uh remote controls and uh well the tables look very nice to read but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you {vocalsound} use it only once per session, but it is very relevant. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: People want to have a power button. Channel selection is uh o often used {disfmarker} very often used and indeed uh very relevant.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Ah {vocalsound} now I remember what is R_S_I_ {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: it's repetitivity stress injury. {vocalsound} We have to be careful with that word but {vocalsound} uh anyway
Industrial Designer: Uh.
Marketing: I continue my presentation so {disfmarker} yeah,
User Interface: {vocalsound}
Marketing: channel selection is um very important, very often used. Volume is not often used but people uh want to have control on volume and that makes sense of course. And n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings. Audio settings, screen settings, even teletext and channel settings. All of them. they're not often used and they are s more or less relevant. It seems that people find teletext teletext uh relevant, even if I personally never use it but seems that it's average relevant at least, so.
Project Manager: I have been told that we uh don't consider teletext, that it's out of date now because of internet.
Marketing: I can tell you that uh in a l in a scale between one and ten relevant uh not relevant to relevant people scored a six on this, which is not as uh these these two one were {disfmarker} had I think ten I think.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: But but if you compare with these ones, uh I think they scored a one or two.
Industrial Designer: Hmm.
Marketing: Not very relevant, so if if there are good reason not to put teletext it's okay but just know that people find it somehow relevant.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: That's for the main functions I think and uh then we can ask uh ourself uh what people don't have that may be useful. For instance I think {disfmarker} net next slide. {vocalsound} One of the thing {disfmarker} the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility {disfmarker} the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control, so you wouldn't have to tap tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want. So we've conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind of uh functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age. Young people, probably because it's a buzz word, find it very relevant. And uh as the age goes up {vocalsound} the {vocalsound} the relevance goes down.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound} So now it really depends on the kind of uh targeting uh wha who are we targeting with this remote control?
Industrial Designer: 'Cause {disfmarker}
Marketing: I think if we are targeting young people then uh it's probably something we have to consider. If we are targeting you very old people this is something they really don't know why they {disfmarker} this should be so now
Project Manager: Mm-mm. Okay.
Marketing: this is of course, depends on that. And um I don't have any conclusion, I didn't have time the meeting was very tight, so that's basically my findings. And uh, if you have any question?
Project Manager: Mm I think it's good, okay. You done a good review.
User Interface: I got one question,
Marketing: I can go back.
Industrial Designer: Thank you.
Marketing: Yeah one question,
User Interface: uh you are a Market Expert
Marketing: yeah?
User Interface: so
Marketing: I am. {vocalsound}
User Interface: should we aim at the young people or not?
Marketing: I think we should aim at the young people. But uh I think they are {disfmarker} they are those uh who might be more interested in a in a new device.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Marketing: In general the the early adopters of a new device are young people, less than {disfmarker} more than {disfmarker}
User Interface: Okay, then teletext is used less.
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: Then teletext is useless for them I think,
User Interface: Okay.
Marketing: yeah. Because they they have other means of finding their information. Yeah.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm mm mm. Okay.
User Interface: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: That's good point.
Marketing: But {disfmarker} yeah. Nope.
Industrial Designer: Mm, yep.
User Interface: Mm. Okay.
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: 'Kay?
Industrial Designer: Thank you.
Project Manager: So um now I think it's the turn of the the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I'm not sure um {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Of the technical function, so {vocalsound} uh
Marketing: So I think it's you, huh?
Industrial Designer: Uh it's
Marketing: No? {vocalsound}
User Interface: {vocalsound} That's me.
Project Manager: what effect {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: techni function of {disfmarker}
Marketing: No, user requiremen
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Okay. Wait a second.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Argh.
Industrial Designer: I have to do working design so uh
Project Manager: So you're {disfmarker}
User Interface: That's {disfmarker} but this but number three, yes. Mm-hmm. So, my name is Mark Dwight, and um I am responsible for User Interface Design.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: However, uh mm Project Manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design. Uh, as I'm a more an artist
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: that's gonna be less technical functions but more User Interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this.
Project Manager: Okay. Let's go.
User Interface: So next slide please. And uh a general method which is {disfmarker} seems to be very useful for our task
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Mm.
User Interface: is not to forget about uh Occam razor. We should never complicate things too much. We should only make a remote control, nothing more. Nothing more than this, just a remote control.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: 'Cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use.
Marketing: Makes sense. {vocalsound}
User Interface: So, make a click, please. So here is this remote control.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: It's quite a standard one, but it's not from a T_V_, it's from a much easier device like air conditioning or something. But you know, we can use it for a T_V_ easily. Only buttons we need is on off, volume, channels and maybe some options or something else, and please make a click, compared to this one
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} It's {disfmarker}
User Interface: which one would you prefer? I guess this.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, yeah.
Marketing: I would say the simplest one as long as there are the uh {disfmarker} I find the buttons that I need every time I need a button.
User Interface: Sure, sure.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Maybe it can be yeah middle of {disfmarker} like, between those two
User Interface: Yeah, and our method is going to be, provide simple
Industrial Designer: li
Project Manager: Oh sorry. {vocalsound}
User Interface: simple desires into simple actions.
Marketing: Nice. Nice sentence.
User Interface: Findings.
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Oh sorry.
User Interface: Our question of the style, we should remember that our company
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: puts fashion into electronics and we should never forget about it.
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Concept.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} S you should {disfmarker} yeah.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Be simple. Be simple and you'll lean on this market.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: Market is a {disfmarker} of remote controls {disfmarker} you know it better,
Marketing: Mm.
User Interface: it's very well, it's it's not an easy field to to play, you know? So be simple.
Marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
User Interface: For personal preferences I think that to make a baby-proof remote control it got to be a titanium.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: It's a really good style, it going to be {disfmarker} look like like this. It is unbreakable and it is very universal. W we'll have a screen with a back light which can change colours,
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: and we can put some buttons on the front that can be easily accessible for a baby. {vocalsound}
