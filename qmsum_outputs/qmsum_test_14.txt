Project Manager: Okay, so now we are on the conceptual design meeting. {vocalsound} Uh y getting close to the last
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: is the penultim meeting. {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: How was lunch? {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Mm great. {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound} Thanks {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing: Don't be sarcastic. {vocalsound} Mark. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: So {vocalsound} um I will again do the secretary part uh we will have three presentation first um uh the industrial design, first Rama then Mark and then Sammy.
Marketing: Uh Rama.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Ramaro.
Project Manager: Um um we have to take a decision on the control {disfmarker} remote control concepts and we have forty minutes.
User Interface: Mm.
Project Manager: So what we want to {disfmarker} the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the um first on the component concept, so what kind of energy we use uh what kind of chip on print and one ki kind of case. And also on user interface concept uh what kind of interface we use and if there is some supplements. And at the end um Sammy will give um {vocalsound} a trend watching on what he's {disfmarker} he's been doing. It's {disfmarker} So, let's go. First with Rama. Participant two.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, participant two. Component.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: Yep. So we're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy, and the material and interface. For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities. First one, we can use simple battery, or we can use {vocalsound} traditional solar cells or {disfmarker} mm and the material we can have plastic, rubber which is good for this R_S_A_
Marketing: Ah.
Industrial Designer: and then uh titanium, which can be {disfmarker} which have very good look an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d L_C_D_ display. And we can use some {gap}, moving {gap} kind of thing. So, as we discussed before, we need to {disfmarker} we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control. So this can be simple kind of programmable chip and {disfmarker} which can use microphone {gap} sensors. And we also want to look at our remote control, so. Still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range, like we're to {disfmarker} in our twelve Euros or around that. So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm, okay.
Industrial Designer: So uh we discussed an {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Excuse me. So we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: and so we would like to just use simple battery. And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or {disfmarker} and well the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes.
Marketing: What is a double-curved shape?
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} Like you can have two curves.
Marketing: Uh-huh.
User Interface: Why?
Industrial Designer: Uh it's {disfmarker} I think in manufacturing I guess it's problematic. So, we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it's really lesser {disfmarker} uh re really less expensive compared to L_C_D_
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: which are uh which needs advanced chip technology and it's more expensive,
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: we want to reduce uh cost.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Um I want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber, if it is something that it seems to be light.
Marketing: The cost.
Industrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} And also like in {disfmarker} if you put a {gap} it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things
Project Manager: Okay. You m titanium it's more uh {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: and {disfmarker} Yeah.
User Interface: W we can use something like you know {vocalsound} the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts like
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Mm like this?
Project Manager: Yes so mm {disfmarker}
User Interface: to make it feel better and to you know {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Like in cell phones recently
Project Manager: Uh-huh.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah. Yeah.
Industrial Designer: these {disfmarker} you can {gap} with the rubber in four directions and {disfmarker}
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Okay. {gap}
Industrial Designer: yeah. But full assembly {disfmarker} We'll use mainly for titanium {gap}
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer: rubber is expensive
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer: and also it's bit difficult to do all the shapes uh.
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer: And this push buttons
Project Manager: Uh yeah so
Industrial Designer: {disfmarker} we we would like to use push buttons instead of L_C_D_s and so we want to mo I mean we're {gap} we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money
Project Manager: Okay, s so simple button and uh speech recognition for the more complicated.
Industrial Designer: for {disfmarker} S S
Marketing: Speech {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology,
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: Okay.
User Interface: Okay, and still we have {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: so {disfmarker}
User Interface: mm can we still include the L_ L_S_D_ display?
Marketing: L_C_D_.
User Interface: L_C_D_ yeah L_C_D_.
Industrial Designer: Uh l
Marketing: Seems not, it's either L_C_D_ or push-button.
Industrial Designer: So uh
User Interface: No,
Industrial Designer: it's like a {disfmarker}
User Interface: it's not gonna be a t no touchable but still like a source of information or source for menus.
Marketing: Ah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah maybe maybe we can see depending on how we'll come up with our full design then if we have enough money or like for and {disfmarker}
User Interface: Okay, so let's try it, let's t
Industrial Designer: because the speech recognition technology will take at least five Euros or {gap} or something so we want to reduce the cost on display
Marketing: {gap} The L_C_D_ would {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: or this inter
Marketing: The display would only be display and not uh touch sensitive you mean.
User Interface: Yeah, yeah, it's it's not gonna be a touch pad, uh just a display for giving you information.
Marketing: Just uh for output, yeah.
Industrial Designer: Ok Yeah, that can we we can consider,
Marketing: Yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: because like it won't take much money I guess,
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: because {disfmarker}
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer: Okay, yep.
Project Manager: {gap} Mm.
Industrial Designer: You have any further questions or?
Marketing: I guess no um. So the batteries uh are going to be very light.
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Yeah, we're to go for li and now I think we have many options in the market so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries
Marketing: Okay.
User Interface: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: for really light batteries and with uh good price.
Marketing: So this device on n that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just uh the finding it basically, instead of clapping why not just be {disfmarker} ask.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, that's {disfmarker} then the the one thing we want to know is like because remote control is used for like in the household so it it it will be it {disfmarker} m maybe at least five, six people want to use it so so how to uh uh how to define our re speech recognition
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: whether we want to do s speaker independent or speaker dependent. If we're going for more speaker independent then it would be like again cumbersome and we need really m more technology
Project Manager: Okay,
Industrial Designer: and so {disfmarker}
Project Manager: for the location. Hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah, if if everybody in the house n {gap} to locate then we're to go for some speaker independent technology or something.
Marketing: Okay. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Okay. So let's now go to the {disfmarker} you don't have more question?
Industrial Designer: {gap}
Marketing: No, it's okay.
Project Manager: Um mm thank you mm.
User Interface: No more questions.
Industrial Designer: Yep. Thank you.
Marketing: Puts less of constraint on what we can do
Project Manager: Yeah.
User Interface: Mm yeah, yeah.
Marketing: but
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: it's always like that. We have dreams and the {disfmarker} in the end we find out that it's not feasible. {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Yeah, but {disfmarker} mm.
Industrial Designer: Oh. We have uh some limitations {gap}. {vocalsound}
Marketing: Anyway. {vocalsound} Yeah.
User Interface: But still uh L_S_D_'s already quite nice,
Marketing: L_C_D_.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay. {vocalsound}
User Interface: L_C_ {vocalsound}
Marketing: L_S_D_ is something else,
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing: and it's quite nice as well. {vocalsound}
User Interface: I'm an artist, sorry. {vocalsound}
Marketing: So,
Project Manager: Um {vocalsound} yeah.
User Interface: So uh, that's not {disfmarker}
Marketing: go on uh artist. {vocalsound}
User Interface: I hope that's not too much.
Project Manager: Now let's talk about uh interface.
User Interface: Okay. {vocalsound} Uh participant number three.
Project Manager: Three.
Industrial Designer: Three.
User Interface: {vocalsound} Uh
Project Manager: Which one? {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Hmm. {vocalsound}
User Interface: mm mm uh have a look at this {disfmarker}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: no it's {disfmarker} yeah.
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Okay.
User Interface: {gap} Uh so the concept of the interface. Generally I developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface, but for possible instruction or user's manual and uh all the complex things that come together with your T_V_ and remote controls. So let's start with this. We got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons
Marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
User Interface: and uh we got explanation for every button
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: and you can use your time and uh it will take i some days to learn all this buttons and um the L_C_D_ is going to be somewhere here and uh go back button, I don't know really where it is, maybe one of this buttons, and um power on and off mm I I don't remember
Project Manager: {vocalsound} Mm.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
User Interface: so uh it it it should be maybe this button is power on and off? Or no {gap}? I can see nothing. So that's our concept. It's called the millennium remote control.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Let's change millenniums. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} So
User Interface: Yeah.
Industrial Designer: maybe you can use {gap} in the end and {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Marketing: {gap} doesn't make sense. This is very {vocalsound} ugly.
User Interface: Really? {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: I thought you like it. Ah okay
Marketing: Oh no,
User Interface: just press the button, please uh. {vocalsound}
Marketing: too much concept.
Project Manager: No.
Marketing: Ah.
Industrial Designer: Uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
User Interface: Yeah, we will not use this. We will not use this.
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
User Interface: But instead of this I will devise {disfmarker} That's our concept.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: Ah, back today. {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
User Interface: And it's got just few buttons, quite low looking, and all this stuff we already we already discussed.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm. 'Kay.
User Interface: And uh what will people say? They'll say it's perfect. Or what will say? Uh they will say it's splendid. And uh e everyone will say I'll buy it.
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound}
Marketing: {vocalsound}
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
Marketing: {gap} Do you think it can come in several colours?
User Interface: And everyone's gonna be satisfied.
Marketing: Or did the {disfmarker}
User Interface: {vocalsound} I would make a backlight of the L_C_D_ screen with different colours.
Marketing: Um but not the case.
User Interface: Not the case.
Marketing: Uh the case would only be in that uh aluminium uh titanium stuff,
User Interface: Yeah.
Marketing: like {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Mm.
Project Manager: Because apparently from your survey people like colours, no?
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Yeah, well they like uh something which is uh {disfmarker}
User Interface: Okay, so let's remember there's a Nokia phone which changeable panels.
Marketing: Mm yeah, okay,
User Interface: Do you like it?
Marketing: so that would be the option. I don't know I don't have a Nokia phone,
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} But it's uh {disfmarker}
Marketing: but I don't use that but again, uh I might {disfmarker}
User Interface: That's why you don't have it. That's why,
Marketing: Yeah,
User Interface: 'cause it's nasty. {vocalsound}
Marketing: bu but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Project Manager: {vocalsound}
Industrial Designer: {vocalsound} But it would be expensive, no? If you use colour L_C_D_.
User Interface: No.
Industrial Designer: Uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Maybe we can just {disfmarker} if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this uh the shapes and they can have different assembly.
User Interface: Um, I am here.
Project Manager: Okay.
Industrial Designer: So users have different {disfmarker} I mean they have their own interests, colour interests and so {disfmarker}
Project Manager: So?
User Interface: Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: So we can just {disfmarker} if they want they can just pay another two Euro.
Project Manager: Uh-huh, okay, so
User Interface: 'Kay.
Project Manager: you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we {disfmarker} if you want o more colours {vocalsound} on L_C_D_,
Industrial Designer: Yeah. Yeah yeah yes. If they want like uh {disfmarker} so that we can {disfmarker} yeah.
Marketing: Kind of upgradable uh {vocalsound} remote control.
Project Manager: yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Project Manager: Okay.
Marketing: Wow, wow.
Industrial Designer: Just they'll get few more things and few more colours.
User Interface: Okay, what uh {disfmarker} there's one more decisi uh one more solution in fact, um {vocalsound} 'cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are, like they can reflect different colours depending on what is around, like what colour is around, and depending on the temperature,
Industrial Designer: Lights, yeah.
Marketing: Mm.
Project Manager: And thermodynamic also. Mm-hmm.
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
Marketing: Like a chameleon.
Project Manager: Mm-hmm.
User Interface: yeah.
Industrial Designer: Yeah yeah.
User Interface: We can make it in fact.
Project Manager: Yeah but that's maybe mo too much expensive, yeah.
User Interface: If if if the {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Mm.
User Interface: okay.
Marketing: Mm-hmm.
Project Manager: But uh it can be in uh maybe in an {disfmarker} a gradable version,
User Interface: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm,
Project Manager: but {disfmarker}
Industrial Designer: Yeah.
User Interface: so {disfmarker}
Marketing: Because uh I think there are two kinds of people. Those for which the remote control is uh is to be uh has uh has a colour change and they are called {disfmarker} uh {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} the people who want to change colours in their home, they are like the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} uh {vocalsound} {vocalsound} people who have a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} people who have a {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
