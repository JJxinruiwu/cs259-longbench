:
* Professor E proposed a new method for detecting overlapping zones (or speech) in real-time, called "block echo cancellation"
* Discussion centered around various challenges and potential pitfalls of implementing block echo cancellation, including:
+ Room noise and reverberations
+ Potential for incorrect implementation of code
+ Need for fine-tuning coefficients for optimal performance
+ Complexity and computational requirements
