In the provided transcript, we can infer that the professor viewed MSG as an effective method for improving recognition accuracy.
He suggested two major improvements to MSG:
1. Consider using other features than MFCC, especially for difficult tasks.
2. Use delta-delta feature combination.
3. Apply multi-band filtering (including noise reduction).
4. Train with a large training set (several databases) including TIMIT.
However, the limitations noted include:
* Limited exploration of potential alternatives
* Insufficient attention to the effect of noise
