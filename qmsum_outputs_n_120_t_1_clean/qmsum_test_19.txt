The speaker explained the concept of speech overlap, also referred to as speaker recognition or matching. Here's what was said:
"When we talk, the sound waves bounce off our mouths, and the audio signal is picked up by microphones placed inside the mouth. As people speak, these sound waves interact with their vocal cords and cause slight distortions in the audio signal."
"Two people talk simultaneously, and their speech signals arrive at a processing center via analog cables. The processed speech signals are then converted into digital data using algorithms such as maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) or Hidden Markov Models
