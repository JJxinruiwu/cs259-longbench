Describe the various functionalities of the remote control, including speech recognition, volume control, and gesture recognition.
The conversation centered around the requirements of the remote control. As discussed in the meeting notes, the project manager asked the team members to elaborate on their roles, responsibilities, and ideas regarding the remote control.
**Summary**
The remote control is designed with various functionalities:
* **Speech Recognition**: Voice commands are supported via a built-in microphone, allowing users to control the TV using spoken commands.
* **Volume Control**: Users can adjust the volume level, and it will automatically lower the audio output to avoid distortion.
* **Gesture Recognition**: Users can perform various gestures to navigate the TV, such as tapping, swiping, and pinching.
* **Automatic On/Off Functionality**: The TV can turn on/off with ease by simply waving the remote or selecting the "On/Off" option.
* **Additional Features**:
+ Automatic on/off control with volume: allows users to set the volume and switch to "Auto" mode.
+ Whistle and clap detection: provides notifications when a user makes these sound effects while controlling the TV.
These functionalities are achieved through various components, including:
* Microphone for speech recognition
* Power circuitry for automatic on/off functionality
* Motorized wheels for gesture recognition
The team has proposed various concepts for the remote control, including integrating the whistle/clap detection feature into existing components, utilizing motion sensors to track gestures, and adding additional modules for future development.
