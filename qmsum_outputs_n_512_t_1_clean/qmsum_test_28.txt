minutes.
**Summary**
The meeting was attended by Graduates, Dr. Thompson (presenter), Dr. Patel (Dr. Thompson's colleague), Ph.D. students, and Dr. Felton.
1. The topic included the project on Speaker Recognition in Acoustic Systems (SRAS) using Neural Networks.
2. The group discussed various aspects of the project including:
* Alignment (e.g., soft targets, embedded training)
* Hidden Unit Size (30 vs. 80)
3. Dr. Patterson presented his observations on how SRAS benefits from using posterior features
4. A debate emerged regarding the role of embeddings in learning representations
**Action Items**
* Dr. Felton to investigate possible modifications to align with the study by Dr. Patterson (e.g., incorporating pre-trained embeddings)
* Dr. Thompson to communicate with Dr. Patterson on further alignment ideas
* Discuss with graduate students to incorporate the insights gained from the research into their projects.
