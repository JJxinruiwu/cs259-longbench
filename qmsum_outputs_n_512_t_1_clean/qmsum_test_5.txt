They seem to be following a pattern, starting by discussing the functionality, then moving on to the design, and finally to the implementation. What changes should we make before presenting the finished prototype?
ANSWER
The key is to identify the common elements and improvements made during the prototype development process. The correct answer is not directly stated in the text, but it can be inferred from the patterns observed.
Some potential changes that could enhance the presentation include:
* Refining the interface to provide feedback for users and improve overall usability.
* Incorporating more diverse user interactions to demonstrate adaptability and flexibility.
* Enhancing the presentation with animations, transitions, or other multimedia elements to engage the audience.
* Providing more detailed information about the technical specifications and components used in the prototype.
* Including a "build" or "test" phase to simulate real-world usage and gather feedback from stakeholders.
By addressing these areas, we can create a more polished and engaging prototype that effectively showcases the innovative features of the device and provides value to potential customers.
