Summary of Debate On The Provision Of Free Childcare Services For All Families With Children Under The Age Of Five
Section 47 - Provision Of Free Childcare Services - Proposed
As a result of the public service Chairman's office publication on the proposed legislation of the Ministry of Finance, the provisional budget for childcare and education services was published on March 16th. The provision of free childcare services for all families with children under the age of five was an explicit priority for the Government.
An inquiry was carried out by the Cabinet Office to assess the potential costs associated with implementing free childcare services for all children under the age of five. Although the inquiry recommended a range of alternatives to achieving free childcare services, none of these alternatives resulted in a full free-service policy.
However, several compromises were suggested to address the initial findings and arrive at a more practical solution for the proposed legislation.
