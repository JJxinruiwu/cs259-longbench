The marketing team discussed finding current trends, specifically mentioning popular trends among younger generations such as preference for fruit and vegetables (as well as materials like fruit leather and vegetable wraps), as well as fashion trends, sports equipment, gaming peripherals, and handheld electronics.
As for the topic of "trend-watching", they talked about observing markets to determine key trends. They mentioned specific observations, including:
* Younger generations preferring products and services related to food, wellness, and self-improvement.
* Increasing interest in gaming, esports, and streaming platforms.
* Growing demand for sustainable, eco-friendly, and environmentally conscious products.
* Rising popularity of lifestyle brands, fast fashion, and trendy athleisure wear.
