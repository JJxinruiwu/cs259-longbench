[KIRSTY WILLIAMS]: I wouldn’t use the word ‘agnostics’, but what I’m in favour of is a healthy, strong and sustainable HE sector. I think what you’d be looking to do is have more analysis and research into the outcomes for learners from different backgrounds, because, from my experience and observations, it seems like there are differences in terms of the level of demand and participation among various groups within the student population.
[HUFFIN DAVID]: Did Kirsty Williams’ opposition to more HEFEC merger go further?
[KIRSTY WILLIAMS]: Actually, I think my opposition went further – that you’re advocating the continuation of the current HEFEC structure rather than an attempt to merge it with a different commission in the future. [Laughter.]
[ELUNEED MORRAGAN]: I was left a bit unsure about Jane Finestone’s response to my point that there were two letters that mentioned the existence of essay mills. Would Jane kindly explain?
[COLIN RIORONDA]: Yes. As a matter of fact, Professor Colin Riordan sent us a letter to the committee regarding essay mills in August of this year. He had requested that we, the committee, investigate the matter further, and asked that we work with Vice-Chancellors in England to develop proposals for tackling academic misconduct. He stated explicitly that essay mills were illegalized by the UK government in July and the QAA will be publishing a draft bill by November next year.
