The meeting took place during [dates].  It involved many conversations. The discussion centered on creating a brand-new type of smartphone called the "SmartPhone", developed by an Industrial Designer, a Product Manager, a Marketing team, and an Audience.
They started with brainstorming session discussing the ideas about Smartphones. One of the ideas came up was to create a design for this Smartphone, known as SmartPhone. It was determined that the SmartPhone would have the unique feature of having multiple colors (e.g. red, blue) and various designs.
One particular topic raised concerns regarding the material quality, specifically the front, or rather the back of the SmartPhone. As per the discussion, the manufacturer has decided to select the Material, including metals, ceramics, composites, woods, alloys, resins, polycyclic polyethylene resins, carbon fibers, glass, ceramic. Furthermore, the interior construction would be metallic foils.
However, at some point, Project Manager's attention became split between the discussion, leading to him getting distracted while chatting with Marketing team. It appears that a considerable amount of communication time has been wasted.
Marketing team expressed some doubts regarding this project, indicating concerns in terms of the consumer behavior aspect ("they are looking at their friends' watches"), suggesting an uncertainty in selling SmartPhones with the current trends. It appears to be an ongoing issue for the designers.
