[LIVE AND UP-TO-DATE SPEAKERS]
*The text appears to suggest the following points:
1/ There was significant variation in the number of teachers recruited to various levels of priority.
2/ It appears that factors influencing recruitment rates included quality of education provided, motivation among prospective pupils, and socio-economic status.
3/ This trend seemed to favor applicants from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, possibly due to limited exposure to better-off families and weaker parental relationships.
4/ The importance of socio-economic factors was reinforced in subsequent talks involving academics and administrators.
5/ The proportion of aspiring teachers from low-income communities declined sharply during the period in question.)
6/ Factors associated with improved socio-economic status included receiving comprehensive education, exposure to arts and culture, stronger ties with family and friends, and greater educational opportunities in the home environment.
7/ Additionally, factors connected with improved socio-economic status included:
a) Living in a larger house or a separate apartment
b) Having closer neighbors
c) Being taught by teachers who were professionals
8) An emphasis on improving socio-economic status was seen as vital to ensuring that a sufficient number of young people stayed in the lower socio-economic classes as opposed to opting out by leaving academia for the professional elite.
