The discussion covered the main issues that arise and explored the different perspectives of the party members on the matter. In particular, the party members discussed the potential disparities between the £4.50 hourly rate, the proposal to raise it in more-expensive areas, and the potential impact on working parents with dependents, particularly those with children born during the winter months who face reduced employment opportunities. They also examined whether Welsh Government policies could provide a more equitable alternative, considering the significant difference between Wales and England in regards to childcare provision. Furthermore, they discussed the need to integrate Welsh Government policies with those of the UK Government to maximize effectiveness. Additionally, they reviewed specific proposals put forward by party members to mitigate potential harms, such as making free childcare available to parents whose children fall outside the main targets date while exploring various options for addressing the impact of rising temperatures on school readiness, which raises concerns about a widening gap in socio-economic disparities among disadvantaged students.
