The Group discussed that:
* A Universal Remote Control (URC) with Speech Recognition capabilities would have to have "speech recognition", "infrared", "Laser, Emitting Diode (LED)", "touch-free" and a built-in microprocessor.
* They would consider the "tapping-to-speak" concept of voice-based communication.
* The voice-activated interface could be achieved via the following steps:
+ First, develop a system for recognizing speaker voice (voice recognition).
+ Second, build interfaces for controlling the remote control (e.g., volume adjustment, switching).
+ Third, consider the design of the overall user experience.
+ Finally, evaluate and test the integration of speech recognition systems.
They mentioned examples such as a video streaming service with a built-in remote control, allowing users to control playback with voice commands.
However, they also noted the importance of designing a user-friendly interface that takes into account factors such as voice latency, sensitivity, and accuracy. Moreover, they recommended considering different voice patterns and accents to improve the functionality.
