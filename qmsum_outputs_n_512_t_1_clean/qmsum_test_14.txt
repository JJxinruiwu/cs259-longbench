The designer, Industrial Designer (ID), presented a case for how to design a trend-telling remote control, emphasizing the importance of combining functionality with aesthetic appeal.
The designer showed various design concepts, including a futuristic remote control with sleek lines and vibrant colors. However, ID dismissed the designer's idea of a single color scheme, pointing out that most people tend to be attracted to certain colors and patterns based on cultural trends and nostalgia.
Instead, ID suggested a dual-color approach, incorporating elements of "fruit" and "vegetables," resembling a banana. He also proposed adding a 3D-printed titanium panel with the manufacturer's logo to give it a luxurious feel.
As they explored further, ID highlighted the importance of incorporating multiple functions, like sound systems or games, while maintaining a clear visual identity. He pointed out that even when combined with high-end features like titanium materials, practical considerations such as aesthetics and brand loyalty remain crucial.
Ultimately, ID concluded that designing a trend-telling remote control requires striking a balance between cutting-edge style and accessible functionality, and offered a few design suggestions for exploring this idea further.
