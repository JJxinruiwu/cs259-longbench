ANSWER: Grad F: Hi, hi! My name is [name] and I'm a grad student. Today's meeting went well. After introducing myself and explaining my background and current projects, we started discussing the topic of recognizing spoken English. I presented slides on the current state of the art and discussed the challenges in building a robust English recognition system. Grad F asked questions about the limitations of the current systems and proposed some potential improvements.
The meeting focused on recognizing spoken English with wireless mikes, specifically for the purposes of capturing the nuances of speech quality during noisy environments. I presented on the pros and cons of using different types of wireless mikes, including wired mikes, Bluetooth, and RF mikes, as well as their respective advantages and disadvantages.
One of the main topics discussed was the importance of considering the characteristics of spoken English, such as variability and ambiguity, when designing a recognition system. I shared some examples of how existing systems struggled to capture nuanced variations in speech quality due to the lack of consideration for these factors.
Another important aspect of the discussion was the role of noise reduction techniques in improving the accuracy of spoken English recognition.
