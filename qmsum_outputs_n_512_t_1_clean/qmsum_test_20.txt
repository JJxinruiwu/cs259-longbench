There is no decision on the microphone procedure. Post-doc G mentions the intention to use wireless mikes, but there is no discussion or decision regarding the specific type of microphone (wireless vs wired). Additionally, the microphone setup appears to be a generic approach without specifying whether the microphone is wired or wireless.
The discussion centered around the details of the microphone testing, including the decision not to perform the initial test with the closed-back design (as intended), the introduction of the open-back design (with headphones) during a pre-test session, and the decision to proceed with further analysis under the assumption that the microphone setup would provide accurate results.
