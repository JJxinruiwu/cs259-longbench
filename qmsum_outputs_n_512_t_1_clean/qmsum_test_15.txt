Answer: 1. He thought there were issues with reverberation, especially with the method of computing reverberation in the VAD.
2. He discussed using VAD and HTK to improve the speech recognition performance.
3. He compared the two approaches and determined that the improvements are similar.
4. He analyzed the potential causes of these improvements, including changes in audio equipment.
5. He noted that reverberation might be reduced by using various features such as acoustic modeling.
6. He suggested implementing a feature like reverberation compensation to reduce the impact of echoes.
7. He considered using the mean phase to subtract unwanted noise, which improved SNR estimates.
