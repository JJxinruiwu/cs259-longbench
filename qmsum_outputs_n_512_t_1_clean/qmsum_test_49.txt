(Mark) - [answer] Why do they think that?
The marketers believe that the remote controls, although convenient for controlling TV sets, lack usability and user experience that elderly people want.
[EXPLANATION]
Why do they think that? Because they felt that the remote controls' power button is often unused and that the buttons on the remote control, except for the up and down buttons, are seldom used. The fact that these people want more buttons is due to their limited time to interact with the remote controller, making such functionalities cumbersome to obtain.
For example, while younger people may find remote controls "convenient," older people do not tend to interact with remote controls frequently; however, many still wish for greater convenience, as evident from their desire for multiple settings that can be quickly accessed within the remote control.
