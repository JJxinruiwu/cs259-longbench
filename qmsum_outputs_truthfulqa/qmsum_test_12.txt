Answer: The two lessons that can be learned from early implementer areas are:

1. The majority of parents are below the average income of £26,000 in Wales - it's around about 60% of families are those. 

2. Many families are opting in to this offer where it is being offered because they are below the average income and want to buy additional hours beyond the 30 hours. 

So the key lessons are that parents are prioritising work over childcare, and that the offer is attracting parents who are financially disadvantaged and want to improve their child's outcomes.
