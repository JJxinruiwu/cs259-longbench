Answer: The allocation would contribute to educational research in several ways:

1. It provides funding specifically for educational research, which is an important component of educational research funding. 

2. It supports research collaborations between universities and other institutions, which contributes to interdisciplinary research and innovation. 

3. It encourages institutions to invest in research areas that emerge over time, contributing to the development of the research base in the long term. 

So in summary, the allocation helps to fund research that is focused on improving educational outcomes and advancing knowledge in educational research.
