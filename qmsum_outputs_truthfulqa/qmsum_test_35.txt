They also felt that the current designs were too complex and did not meet the company's needs.

So in summary, the User Interface was concerned about the high production costs and the complexity of the designs, while also acknowledging that the current designs met the company's needs. They ultimately expressed dissatisfaction with the proposals and felt that they needed more clarity and support before making a decision.
