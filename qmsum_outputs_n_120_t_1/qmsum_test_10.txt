[ANSWER]
He mentioned it's going to take a lot of work to implement it and is uncertain if it's the best solution.

PhD A:
The proposal was related to the development of a Voice Activity Detection (VAD) system, which aims to detect whether speech is present in an audio signal. One approach considered is using a linear predictive coherence (LPC) analysis. Another approach discussed was a Wiener-based filtering technique to improve detection accuracy.
It seems that the discussion centered around implementing improvements to the existing VAD algorithms, such as:
